# Shifting focus
passive sentences

## be + -en form
We use the *-en form* to shift focus.

We use *be(am/is/are/was/were)* and the *-en form* to focus on what the verb relates to, rather that who or what does it.

|Subject|*Verb*|*Object*|Place/Time|
|I|**ate**|**breakfast**|at 6:00.|

> **I** ate **breakfast** at 6:00.
> - We say **who** ate and **what** they ate.

|*Subject*|*be*|*Verb(-en)*|Place/Time|
|**Breakfast**|**was**|**eaten**|at 6:00.|

> **Breakfast** was eaten at 6:00.
> - We focus on **breakfast**.
> - Who ate it is not important.

In the first sentence, *breakfast* is the **object**. In the second sentence, *breakfast* is the **subject**.

Making *breakfast* the subject gives it more focus.

We use *be(was)* because we are referring to breakfast as a whole. We are talking about breakfast and describing what happens to it.

Compare the *-ing form* and the *-en form*.

|*The chicken* is **eating**.|*The chicken* is **eaten**.|
|*We are saying what the chicken is doing. (now)*|*We are saying what happens to the chicken. (generally) Who or what does it is not important.*|

|*People eat fish at the restaurant.*|*Fish have eaten food at the restaurant.*|

We use the *present form* of *be* to talk about things that are generally true. We also add *by* to say who or what does it.

|Subject|*be*|*Verb(-en)*|*Person/Method*|Place/Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|These bags|**are**|**made**||in Denmark.|
|Elephants|**aren't**|**found**||in this region.|
|The website|**is**|**updated**|**by our staff**|every day.|

We use the *past form* of *be* to talk about things that happened in the past.
|Subject|*be(past)*|*Verb(-en)*|*Person/Method*|Place/Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|These bags|**were**|**made**||in Denmark.|
|He|**was**|**born**||in 1951.|
|My camera|**was**|**stolen**||last week.|
|Electricity|**was**|**discovered**|**by Benjamin Franklin**|in 1752.|
|The bags|**were**|**sewn**|**by hand**.||

We also say: 
> Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity in 1752
> - This puts focus on Benjamin Franklin. He did it.

When we use *be* and the *-en form* we don't need to say who did it.
> Electricity was discovered in 1752.
> - We are just focusing on electricity.
