# Adverbs
front, mid and end position

## saying where, when and how
We can say *where, when* and *how* with just **one word**, an **adverb** (for example: *home, tomorrow, automatically*). We use **adverbs** in the same way we use expressions with *at, in, on, to, for, with, by* etc.
|wh-||Subject|Verb|*Place/Time/Description*|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Where|did|you|go?||
|||*I*|*went*|**overseas**.|
|||*I*|*went*|to Africa.|
|When|is|the game?||
|||*It*|*is*|**tomorrow**.|
|||*It*|*is*|on Wednesday.|
|How|does|the door|open?||
|||*It*|*opens*|**automatically**.|
|||*It*|*opens*|by itself.|

These **adverbs** describe **where** things happen.

They have **general** meanings.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*Where*|
|---|---|---|---|
|He|went||**home**.|
|There|is|a shop|**nearby**.|
|She|took|her bag|**upstairs**.|
|I|'ll see|you|**around**.|
|The plane|flew||**up**.|

We also use *at, in, on, to, for, with, by etc. in these situations for **specific** information.
> He traveled **to** Africa.
>
> There's a shop **on** this street.
>
> She took her bag **to** her room.
>
> I'll see you **in** class.
>
> The plane flew **into** the sky.

These **adverbs** describe **when** things happen.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*When*|
|---|---|---|---|
|He|plays|tennis|**sometimes**.|
|They|exercise||**regularly**.|
|She|went|to work|**early**.|
|I|'ll see|you|**again**.|
> He plays tennis **on** Mondays.
>
> They exercise **at** 5PM.
>
> She went to work **at** 6AM.
>
> I'll see you **in** July.

These **adverbs** describe **how** things happen.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*How*|
|---|---|---|---|
|She|plays|tennis|**well**.|
|He|solved|the problem|**simply**.|
|We|went|to the park|**together**.|
|The bus|stopped||**suddenly**.|

---

## adding information to verbs
We use **adjectives** to add information to ***nouns***.
|*Subject*|Verb|*Object*|
|---|---|---|
|She|drives|a **normal** car.|
|He|spoke|with a **soft** voice.|
|The **lucky** man|won|the lottery.|

We use **adverbs** to add information to things that are not nouns. We add information to ***verbs***.
|Subject|*Adverb + Verb*|Object|
|---|---|---|
|She|**normally** drives|a car.|
|He|**softly** spoke.||
|He|**luckily** found|the ticket.|

There is often more than one way to think about things. The pairs of sentences below have the same basic meaning, so either one can be used in the same situation. Some adverbs can be used **before** the verb, or for added information at the **end** of the sentence.
> The bus **suddenly** stopped.
> - (**what** happened: *suddenly* describes stop)
>
> The bus stopped **suddenly**. (**how**: *suddenly* describes **how** the bus stopped)
>
> I **sometimes** play tennis.
> - (**what** happens: I sometimes play)
>
> I play tennis **sometimes**. 
> - (**when** I play: from time to time)

Adverbs that give an **opinion** go at the end. We are not simply saying what happens, we are saying **how** we think it happens.
> She plays tennis **well**.
> - (**how** she plays: what I think)
>
> He sang the song **perfectly**.
> - (**how** he sang: what I think)
>
> That'll do **nicely**.
> - (**how** it will do: what I think)

We put the adverb before verbs to say how **factual** something is or how **likely** it is to be **true**.
> He **definitely** did it.
> - (**what** happened: this is factual information based on evidence)
>
> I'll **probably** go shopping tomorrow.
> - (**what** is likely based on my plans)
>
> It's **certainly** a good idea.
> - (**what** it is: there is no question about it - it's a fact.)
>
> I **almost** lost my phone.
> - (**what** was close to happening. In fact, it didn't happen)
>
> I **just** finished in time.
> - (**what** was close to not happening. In fact, it did happen)

### Practice

## linking and emphasize
We move added information about time to the start of the sentence to emphasize it. We are talking about **when** we do particular things.
> We're going to the zoo **tomorrow**.
> - When is added at the end.
>
> **Tomorrow** we're going to the zoo.
> - There is more emphasize on **when**.
>
> We're going to the museum **on Monday**.
> - When is added at the end.
>
> **On Monday** we're going to the museum.
> - There is more emphasize on **when**.

We start sentences with adverbs to help put the sentence in perspective for the listener. We sometimes connect the sentence to what the listener knows or what was previously said.
|*Adverb*|Subject|Verb|Object|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Personally,|I|like|watching tennis.||
|However,|I|'ve never played|tennis.||
|Maybe|I|'ll try|it|tomorrow.|
> *We often use a comma (,) or a pause when speaking to separate the adverb from the rest of the sentence. We often use the adverb to give perspective, pause, then continue.*

We can also use *personally* before the verb because we are saying what I do.
> I **personally** like tennis.
> - (what I like)

We move *when* or *how* information to the start of the sentence for emphasize.
> **Suddenly**, the bus stopped.
> - (emphasize on **how**)
>
> The bus stopped **suddenly**.
> - (how the bus stopped)
>
> The bus **suddenly** stopped.
> - (what happened)
>
> **Sometimes** I play tennis.
> - (emphasize on **when**)
>
> I play tennis **sometimes**.
> - (when I play: from time to time)
>
> I **sometimes** play tennis.
> - (what happens: I sometimes play)

### Practice
Choose a position for the words in brackets. Leave the other spaces blank. 

Which do you think is best? There may be more than one answer.
1. (yesterday morning) ____ I ____ was half asleep ____. The doorbell rang.
2. (slowly) ____ I ____ crawled out of bed ____ and went to the door. It was the postman.
3. (suddenly) While I was talking to him, ____ the door ____ blew closed ____ behind me.
4. (unfortunately) ____ I was ____ locked out of the house ____, in my pajamas.
5. (luckily) I went around the back and ____ a window was ____ left open ____.

> Then sentences above are also good without adverbs. Adverbs used in this way provide additional information. Use them only when you feel they are needed.

---

## start, middle or end?
We put adverbs in different parts of sentences for different reasons.
> **Now** I like it.
> - Saying when.
> - At the start to emphasize that I didn't like it before. (most common)
>
> I like it **now**.
> - Saying when. (also very common)
>
> I **now** like it.
> - Information (that this is current) is added to the verb. (more formal)


The place the adverb is in the sentence often depends on the meaning of the verb. The same adverb is often added in different places depending on how the speaker is thinking.
> He'll do it **soon**.
> - Saying **when** he will do it.
>
> He'll **soon** forget it.
> - Saying **what** he will **do** (the adverb gives more information about the verb - soon forget, never forget etc.)

    NOTE: 'He'll soon do it' and 'He'll forget it soon' are both possible but not as common.

Sometimes the position of an adverb can change the meaning.

|![](./27.%20Adverbs/start,%20middle%20or%20end%2001.png)|![](./27.%20Adverbs/start,%20middle%20or%20end%2002.png)|
|*(**What** normally/usually happens) Working like that is normal. But, it **doesn't work** now.*|*(**how**: in a normal way - as expected) It **works** now.*|

We can also say: 
> **Normally**, it works when I press this buttion.
> - (normally = when everything is normal)

### Practice
Complete the sentences. Leave one space blank.
1. (naturally) She didn't have a c-section, ____ she gave birth ____.
2. (naturally) She was at the end of the pregnancy, so ____ she gave birth ____.
3. (clearly) Please speak up. We ____ can't hear you ____ at the back.
4. (clearly) Tap him on his shoulder to get his attention. He ____ can't hear you ____.
5. (normally) We didn't know they were famous so we ____ treated them ____.
6. (normally) People ____ treat them speical ____.
7. (simply) We ____ told them ____ what we needed and they gave it to us.
8. (simply) What a great solution, how did you ____ do it so ____?

## sayinig how often
When we say how often something happens we usually put the adverb **before** the verb.
|Subject|*Adverb + Verb*|Object|
|---|---|---|
|I|**always** do|the dishes.|
|I|**usually** do|the dishes.|
|I|**often** do|the dishes.|
|I|**sometimes** do|the dishes.|
|I|**rarely** do|the dishes.|
|I|**never** do|the dishes.|
> Adds information to the verb: **do** the dishes.
> 
> ![](./27.%20Adverbs/start,%20middle%20or%20end%2003.png)

We also use *usually, often* and *sometimes* to say **when** something happens. These adverbs are used for added information at the **end** of the sentence.

We use *sometime* to talk about something that will or may happen in the future.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*When*|
|---|---|---|---|
|I|do|the dishes|**usually**.|
|I|do|the dishes|**often**.|
|I|do|the dishes|**sometimes**.|
|I|'ll do|the dishes|**sometime**.|
> Saying when: many times or at one time.
> 
> ![](./27.%20Adverbs/start,%20middle%20or%20end%2004.png)

We put *usually, often, sometimes* and *sometime* **first** for examples.
|*When*|Subject|Verb|Object|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Usually**|I|do|the dishes.|
|**Often**|I|do|the dishes.|
|**Sometimes**|I|do|the dishes.|
|**Sometime**|I|'ll do|the dishes.|
> Saying when: many times or at one time.
>
> ![](./27.%20Adverbs/start,%20middle%20or%20end%2004.png)

Putting *sometimes* **first** is very common, but we often use it in the middle or end of a sentence too.

Then meaning is essentially the same. They are just different ways of thinking and constructing sentences. It is very common to use *one day* or *someday* instead of *sometime*.

We usualy use *always* before the verb.
|Subject|*Adverb + Verb*|Object|
|---|---|---|
|I|will **always** love|you.|

It is also possible to use *always* to say **when** (meaning forever), but only for things that are permanent.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*When*|
|---|---|---|---|
|I|will love|you|**always**.|

Love is considered permanent and we add *always* to make the sentence stronger.
> I will **always** love you.
> - (**what** will happen)
>
> I will love you **always**.
> - (**when** = always/forever)

> Emphasizing *always* at the start of the sentence is not common. We use *always* in the middle or at the end of the sentence to emphasize *love*.

We also use *always* with the *-ing form*.
> Life is good. I'm **always** going out and meeting with friends.
> - It seems like this is what I am doing at any given time.

We sometimes don't think it's right that it always happens.
> He's **always** going out and meeting with friends. He should focus on his studies!
> - It seems like this is what he is doing at any given time - and I've had enough of it.

*Never* says something **doesn't happen**. It doesn't say when, so we don't put *never* at the start or end of the sentence.
> He **never** goes out. ≈ He **doesn't** go out.
> - (never is stronger, doesn't is softer)

### Practice

A: What do you do on the weekend?
1. B: Lots of things. (usually) ____ I ____ go to the park ____.

### Practice
Complete the sentences. Leave one space blank. Which word order do you think is best?
1. I work really long hours. (usually) I ____ don't ____ get home in time for dinner.
2. (often) I ____ don't ____ get home until 11PM.
3. (often) We ____ don't ____ have visitors, but my cousin is staying with us this week.

5. (always) We ____ don't ____ have our meals together, but we're having dinner together on Friday.
6. (usually) I ____ don't ____ go out on Fridays but it's special occasion.

Some adverbs (such as *probably, certainly* and *definitely*) are useful when talking about options and possibilities (with *will/would, can/could* and *should*).

In positive sentences, we usually put the adverb after the first verb. We use *probably* when we decide that out of many options or possibilities, this one is likely.
> I **'ll probably** get a dog.
> 
> ![](./27.%20Adverbs/saying%20how%20often%2001.png)

*I'm thinking abhout my options. (There may be other options too.)*

We put the adverb (*probably*) before the first verb (*will* or *won't*). We put <u>stress</u> on the <u>first verb</u> and emphasize what is likely to **<u>happen</u>** or **<u>not happen</u>**.
|||
|---|---|
|I **probably <u>will</u>** get a dog.|I **probably <u>won't</u>** get a dog.|
|![](./27.%20Adverbs/saying%20how%20often%2002.png)|![](./27.%20Adverbs/saying%20how%20often%2003.png)|

When there is no word to stress, we add and <u>stress</u> *do*. We focus on what does or doesn't happen.
|||
|--|--|
|She **probably does** like him.|She **probably doesn't** like him.|

|||
|--|--|
|We use *do* before the adverb to emphasize every time, many times or more than one time.|We use *do* after the adverb to emphasize what happens.|
|He <u>does</u> **always** do the dishes.|He **always** <u>does</u> do the dishes.|
|I <u>do</u> **usually** like seafood.|I **usually** <u>do</u> like seafood.|
|We <u>do</u> **often** have parties.|We **often** <u>do</u> have parties.|
|Amazing things <u>do</u> **sometimes** happen.|Amazing things **sometimes** <u>do</u> happen.|

---

## negative sentences
When we make negative sentences, we put *not* before or after the adverb in different situations.
||||
|---|---|---|
|We use *always* when things happen every time. We use *don't always* when things do **not** happen **every time**.||We use *sometimes* when things happen more than once. We use *sometimes don't* when there is **more than one time** something does **not** happen.|
|I **don't always** do the dishes.|≈|I **sometimes don't** do the dishes.|
|*Not every time: there are times when I do and times when I don't.*||*There are times when it doesn't happen.*|
|![](./27.%20Adverbs/negative%20sentences%2001.png)||![](./27.%20Adverbs/negative%20sentences%2002.png)|

We use *often* and *usually* in either way. We say *don't often* or *often don't*.

*Often* is used when things happen many times.
|||
|--|--|
|We use *don't often* when things do **not** happen **many times** *(but they sometimes happen)*.|We use *often don't* when there are **many times** things do **not** happen.|
|We **don't often** have parties.|I **often don't** have enough time to go to the supermarket after work.|
|*It doesn't happen much, but there are times when it does happen.*|*I want to, but it is often not possible.*|

*Usually* is also used when things happen many times. These things happen almost every time.
|||
|--|--|
|We use *don't usually* when things do **not** happen **many times**. *They rarely happen.*|We use *usually don't* when there are **many times** things do **not** happen. *(almost every time)*|
|I **don't usually** eat at restaurants.|I **usually don't** go to that restaurant because it's expensive.|
|*It generally doesn't happen, but there are times when it does happen.*|*I have a choice. I usually choose not to.*|

There are situations when *don't usually* and *usually don't* both fit. You can say it either way.
||||
|--|--|--|
|I **don't usually** like seafood, but that was delicious!|≈|I **usually don't** like seafood, but that was delicious!|
|*I only like it sometimes, very rarely.*||*There are many times I don't like it.*|

---

## more than one verb
When we use more than one verb, the first verb tell us if a sentence is positive or negative *(with not)*.

We often put adverbs after the first verb and before the other verbs.
|Subject|*Verb*|||Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
||***First Verb***|***Adverb***|***Other Verbs***||
|She|is|**definitely**|working|now.|
|She|will|**probably**|be working|now.|
|She|has|**apparently**|been working|all day.|
|She|will|**actually**|have been working|all day.|

We put adverbs before the first verb to focus on the positive or negative.
|Subject|*Verb*|||Place/Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
||***Adverb***|***First Verb***|***Other Verbs***||
|She|**definitely**|was|working|there last month.|
|She|**probably**|would|be working|somewhere else now.|
|She|**apparently**|hasn't|been working|all week.|
|She|**actually**|won't|have been working|all day.|

Adverbs are used before different verbs for different reasons. It depends on what we are focusing on when we are thinking and speaking. The different in meaning in the sentences below is subtel.
> She **actually** won't have been working all day.
> - Focus on **not** working all day.
>
> She won't **actually** have been working all day.
> - Focus on what she **'s been doing**.
>
> She won't have **actually** been working all day.
> - Focus on what she **was doing**.

We focus on different verbs depending on how we are thinking at the time. The difference in meaning in the sentences below is subtle. The top sentence is more common.
> The population has been **slowly** increasing over the last 10 years. 
> - Focus on the speed of **change**.
>
> The population has **slowly** been increasing over the last 10 years.
> - (not focus)

### Practice
Complete the sentences. Leave one space blank. There may be more than one answer.

A: Do you think you'll come to the barbecue on Sunday?
1. B: (probably) I've been thinking about it, but I ____ won't ____ go.
2. A: Just come. (definitely) You ____ 'll/will ____ enjoy it.
3. (honestly) Sorry, I ____ can't ____ make it this time.
A: That' ok. How have you been anyway?
4. B: Good. (quickly) I ____ 've/have ____ been ____ going through all my notes to revise for the exam tomorrow. It is pretty difficult.
5. (probably) I ____ should ____ have ____ started earlier.

---

## one verb: be
*Be* is often used by itself. It carries little meaning on its own and joins the subject a description, time or place etc. We often put adverbs after *be* the same as if it was the first verb when there is more than one verb.
|Subject|*Verb*|||Description/Time/Place etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|
||***be***|***Adverb***|***Other Verbs***||
|It|is|**definitely**||finished.|
|The meeting|was|**actually**||at 10:15.|
|The meeting|wasn't|**actually**||at 10:15.|
|They|are|**usually**||on holiday.|
|They|aren't|**usually**||on holiday.|
|I|am|**never**||home.|

We put adverbs before *be* to focus on the positive or negative.
|Subject|*Verb*|||Description/Time/Place etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|
||**Adverb**|***be***|***Other Verbs***||
|That|**definitely**|is||him.|
|That|**definitely**|isn't||him.|
|The meeting|**actually**|was||at 10:15.|
|The meeting|**actually**|wasn't||at 10:15.|
|They|**usually**|are||on holiday.|
|They|**usually**|aren't||on holiday.|
|I|**never**|am||home.|

We add emphasize by stressing *be*. *(This is the same as with do. See page 231)*
|||
|---|---|
|That **definitely** <u>is</u> him.|That <u>is</u> **definitely** him.|

## adverbs and adjectives
Many adjectives can be turned into adverbs by adding *-ly*.
||||||||||||
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|normal|->|***normally***||certain|->|***certainly***||happy|->|***happily***|
|soft|->|***softly***||usual|->|***usually***||sad|->|***sadly***|
|lucky|->|***luckily***||natural|->|***naturally***||perfect|->|***perfectly***|
|regular|->|***regularly***||simple|->|***simply***||beautiful|->|***beautifully***|

|*Subject*|Verb|*Object/Place*||Subject|Verb|Object|*How*|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|She|drives|a **slow** car.||She|drives||**slowly**.|
|**Bright** stars|shine|in the night sky.||The stars|are shining||**brightly**.|
|He|wears|**cheap** clothes.||He|got|his clothes|**cheaply**.|

We also use the **adjective** form at the end of sentences. We describe the main noun of the sentence at the time it happens. We are describing a thing rather than the way of doing something.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*Description*|Remarks|
|--|---|--|--|--|
|She|drives||**slow**.|*When* she drives, *she is* slow.|
|The stars|are shining||**bright**.|The stars are shining *now*, *they are* bright.|
|He|got|his clothes|**cheap**.|*When* he got his clothes, *they were* cheap.|

The meaning is essentially the same in the examples above. Sometimes these forms are used in different situations and mean different things.
> We arrived **late**.
> - *When* we arrived, *we **were*** late.
>
> Have you seen any good movies **lately**?
> - Lately tells us **when**. lately ≈ recently.
>
> Please keep the path **clear**.
> - I want the path to **be** clear.
>
> Please speak **clearly**.
> - This is **how** I want you to speak.

Some adjectives don't have an *-ly* adverb form. We use the adjective form at the end of sentences.
> She drives **fast**.
> - *When* she drives, *she is** fast.

### Practice
Complete the sentences. Choose the best form. There may be more than one answer.
1. It went really (fast) (fastly).
2. Please play (safe) (safely).
3. Come (quick) (quickly)! Help!
4. We (hard) (hardly) ever work.
5. We're working (hard) (hardly).
6. We've (near) (nearly) finished.
7. We'll stay home and take it (easy) (easily).
8. I passed the test (easy) (easily).
9. Seafood should be eaten (fresh) (freshly).
10. Add some (fresh) (freshly) ground pepper.

## a lot / any more
We use *a lot of* (before a noun) to describe a large amount.

![](./27.%20Adverbs/a%20lot%20or%20any%20more%2001.png)
|Subject|Verb|*Object*|
|--|--|--|
|I|drink|**a lot of** coffee.|

We use *a lot of* when we talk about one time.
> I drank **a lot of** coffee at breakfast yesterday.
> - (one time: a large amount)

We use *a lot of* to talk about a large number.
> I like **a lot of** sports.
> - (a large number: I like many sports)

We use *a lot* to add information about when: it happens often.

![](./27.%20Adverbs/a%20lot%20or%20any%20more%2002.png)
|Subject|Verb|Object|*When*|
|--|--|--|-|
|I|drink|coffee|**a lot**.|

When we say we do something *a lot*, we are saying that we do it many times.
> I drank coffee **a lot** last year.
> - (many times)

With things that are considered permanent, we add *a lot* to make the sentence stronger.
> I like sports **a lot**.
> - (how much: to what degree)

*Any more* and *anymore* are often used in questions and negative sentences.

We use *any more* (before a noun) to say we have reached the limit: the maximun amount.
|Subject|Verb|*Object*|
|-|-|-|
|I|can't eat|**any more** cake.|
> Would you like *any more* cake?
> - I'm full. I can't eat **any more** cake.

We use *anymore* to add information about when: from that time on.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*When*|
|-|-|-|-|
|I|can't eat|cake|**anymore**.|
> The doctor said I can't eat cake **anymore**.
