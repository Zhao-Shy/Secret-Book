# Adverbs
front, mid and end position

## saying where, when and how
We can say *where, when* and *how* with just **one word**, an **adverb** (for example: *home, tomorrow, automatically*). We use **adverbs** in the same way we use expressions with *at, in, on, to, for, with, by* etc.
|wh-||Subject|Verb|*Place/Time/Description*|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Where|did|you|go?||
|||*I*|*went*|**overseas**.|
|||*I*|*went*|to Africa.|
|When|is|the game?||
|||*It*|*is*|**tomorrow**.|
|||*It*|*is*|on Wednesday.|
|How|does|the door|open?||
|||*It*|*opens*|**automatically**.|
|||*It*|*opens*|by itself.|

These **adverbs** describe **where** things happen.

They have **general** meanings.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*Where*|
|---|---|---|---|
|He|went||**home**.|
|There|is|a shop|**nearby**.|
|She|took|her bag|**upstairs**.|
|I|'ll see|you|**around**.|
|The plane|flew||**up**.|

We also use *at, in, on, to, for, with, by etc. in these situations for **specific** information.
> He traveled **to** Africa.
>
> There's a shop **on** this street.
>
> She took her bag **to** her room.
>
> I'll see you **in** class.
>
> The plane flew **into** the sky.

These **adverbs** describe **when** things happen.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*When*|
|---|---|---|---|
|He|plays|tennis|**sometimes**.|
|They|exercise||**regularly**.|
|She|went|to work|**early**.|
|I|'ll see|you|**again**.|
> He plays tennis **on** Mondays.
>
> They exercise **at** 5PM.
>
> She went to work **at** 6AM.
>
> I'll see you **in** July.

These **adverbs** describe **how** things happen.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*How*|
|---|---|---|---|
|She|plays|tennis|**well**.|
|He|solved|the problem|**simply**.|
|We|went|to the park|**together**.|
|The bus|stopped||**suddenly**.|

## adding information to verbs
We use **adjectives** to add information to ***nouns***.
|*Subject*|Verb|*Object*|
|---|---|---|
|She|drives|a **normal** car.|
|He|spoke|with a **soft** voice.|
|The **lucky** man|won|the lottery.|

We use **adverbs** to add information to things that are not nouns. We add information to ***verbs***.
|Subject|*Adverb + Verb*|Object|
|---|---|---|
|She|**normally** drives|a car.|
|He|**softly** spoke.||
|He|**luckily** found|the ticket.|

There is often more than one way to think about things. The pairs of sentences below have the same basic meaning, so either one can be used in the same situation. Some adverbs can be used **before** the verb, or for added information at the **end** of the sentence.
> The bus **suddenly** stopped.
> - (**what** happened: *suddenly* describes stop)
>
> The bus stopped **suddenly**. (**how**: *suddenly* describes **how** the bus stopped)
>
> I **sometimes** play tennis.
> - (**what** happens: I sometimes play)
>
> I play tennis **sometimes**. 
> - (**when** I play: from time to time)

Adverbs that give an **opinion** go at the end. We are not simply saying what happens, we are saying **how** we think it happens.
> She plays tennis **well**.
> - (**how** she plays: what I think)
>
> He sang the song **perfectly**.
> - (**how** he sang: what I think)
>
> That'll do **nicely**.
> - (**how** it will do: what I think)

We put the adverb before verbs to say how **factual** something is or how **likely** it is to be **true**.
> He **definitely** did it.
> - (**what** happened: this is factual information based on evidence)
>
> I'll **probably** go shopping tomorrow.
> - (**what** is likely based on my plans)
>
> It's **certainly** a good idea.
> - (**what** it is: there is no question about it - it's a fact.)
>
> I **almost** lost my phone.
> - (**what** was close to happening. In fact, it didn't happen)
>
> I **just** finished in time.
> - (**what** was close to not happening. In fact, it did happen)

### Practice

## linking and emphasize
We move added information about time to the start of the sentence to emphasize it. We are talking about **when** we do particular things.
> We're going to the zoo **tomorrow**.
> - When is added at the end.
>
> **Tomorrow** we're going to the zoo.
> - There is more emphasize on **when**.
>
> We're going to the museum **on Monday**.
> - When is added at the end.
>
> **On Monday** we're going to the museum.
> - There is more emphasize on **when**.

We start sentences with adverbs to help put the sentence in perspective for the listener. We sometimes connect the sentence to what the listener knows or what was previously said.
|*Adverb*|Subject|Verb|Object|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Personally,|I|like|watching tennis.||
|However,|I|'ve never played|tennis.||
|Maybe|I|'ll try|it|tomorrow.|
> *We often use a comma (,) or a pause when speaking to separate the adverb from the rest of the sentence. We often use the adverb to give perspective, pause, then continue.*

We can also use *personally* before the verb because we are saying what I do.
> I **personally** like tennis.
> - (what I like)

We move *when* or *how* information to the start of the sentence for emphasize.
> **Suddenly**, the bus stopped.
> - (emphasize on **how**)
>
> The bus stopped **suddenly**.
> - (how the bus stopped)
>
> The bus **suddenly** stopped.
> - (what happened)
>
> **Sometimes** I play tennis.
> - (emphasize on **when**)
>
> I play tennis **sometimes**.
> - (when I play: from time to time)
>
> I **sometimes** play tennis.
> - (what happens: I sometimes play)

### Practice
Choose a position for the words in brackets. Leave the other spaces blank. 

Which do you think is best? There may be more than one answer.
1. (yesterday morning) ____ I ____ was half asleep ____. The doorbell rang.
2. (slowly) ____ I ____ crawled out of bed ____ and went to the door. It was the postman.
3. (suddenly) While I was talking to him, ____ the door ____ blew closed ____ behind me.
4. (unfortunately) ____ I was ____ locked out of the house ____, in my pajamas.
5. (luckily) I went around the back and ____ a window was ____ left open ____.

> Then sentences above are also good without adverbs. Adverbs used in this way provide additional information. Use them only when you feel they are needed.

## start, middle or end?
We put adverbs in different parts of sentences for different reasons.
> **Now** I like it.
> - Saying when.
> - At the start to emphasize that I didn't like it before. (most common)
>
> I like it **now**.
> - Saying when. (also very common)
>
> I **now** like it.
> - Information (that this is current) is added to the verb. (more formal)


The place the adverb is in the sentence often depends on the meaning of the verb. The same adverb is often added in different places depending on how the speaker is thinking.
> He'll do it **soon**.
> - Saying **when** he will do it.
>
> He'll **soon** forget it.
> - Saying **what** he will **do** (the adverb gives more information about the verb - soon forget, never forget etc.)

    NOTE: 'He'll soon do it' and 'He'll forget it soon' are both possible but not as common.

Sometimes the position of an adverb can change the meaning.

|*(**What** normally/usually happens) Working like that is normal. But, it **doesn't work** now.*|*(**how**: in a normal way - as expected) It **works** now.*|

We can also say: 
> **Normally**, it works when I press this buttion.
> - (normally = when everything is normal)

### Practice
Complete the sentences. Leave one space blank.
1. (naturally) She didn't have a c-section, ____ she gave birth ____.
2. (naturally) She was at the end of the pregnancy, so ____ she gave birth ____.
3. (clearly) Please speak up. We ____ can't hear you ____ at the back.
4. (clearly) Tap him on his shoulder to get his attention. He ____ can't hear you ____.
5. (normally) We didn't know they were famous so we ____ treated them ____.
6. (normally) People ____ treat them speical ____.
7. (simply) We ____ told them ____ what we needed and they gave it to us.
8. (simply) What a great solution, how did you ____ do it so ____?

## sayinig how often
When we say how often something happens we usually put the adverb **before** the verb.
|Subject|*Adverb + Verb*|Object|
|---|---|---|
|I|**always** do|the dishes.|
|I|**usually** do|the dishes.|
|I|**often** do|the dishes.|
|I|**sometimes** do|the dishes.|
|I|**rarely** do|the dishes.|
|I|**never** do|the dishes.|
> Adds information to the verb: **do** the dishes.
> 
> ![](./27.%20Adverbs/start,%20middle%20or%20end%2003.png)

We also use *usually, often* and *sometimes* to say **when** something happens. These adverbs are used for added information at the **end** of the sentence.

We use *sometime* to talk about something that will or may happen in the future.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*When*|
|---|---|---|---|
|I|do|the dishes|**usually**.|
|I|do|the dishes|**often**.|
|I|do|the dishes|**sometimes**.|
|I|'ll do|the dishes|**sometime**.|
> Saying when: many times or at one time.
> 
> ![](./27.%20Adverbs/start,%20middle%20or%20end%2004.png)

We put *usually, often, sometimes* and *sometime* **first** for examples.
|*When*|Subject|Verb|Object|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Usually**|I|do|the dishes.|
|**Often**|I|do|the dishes.|
|**Sometimes**|I|do|the dishes.|
|**Sometime**|I|'ll do|the dishes.|
> Saying when: many times or at one time.
>
> ![](./27.%20Adverbs/start,%20middle%20or%20end%2004.png)

Putting *sometimes* **first** is very common, but we often use it in the middle or end of a sentence too.

Then meaning is essentially the same. They are just different ways of thinking and constructing sentences. It is very common to use *one day* or *someday* instead of *sometime*.

We usualy use *always* before the verb.
|Subject|*Adverb + Verb*|Object|
|---|---|---|
|I|will **always** love|you.|

It is also possible to use *always* to say **when** (meaning forever), but only for things that are permanent.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*When*|
|---|---|---|---|
|I|will love|you|**always**.|

Love is considered permanent and we add *always* to make the sentence stronger.
> I will **always** love you.
> - (**what** will happen)
>
> I will love you **always**.
> - (**when** = always/forever)

> Emphasizing *always* at the start of the sentence is not common. We use *always* in the middle or at the end of the sentence to emphasize *love*.

We also use *always* with the *-ing form*.
> Life is good. I'm **always** going out and meeting with friends.
> - It seems like this is what I am doing at any given time.

We sometimes don't think it's right that it always happens.
> He's **always** going out and meeting with friends. He should focus on his studies!
> - It seems like this is what he is doing at any given time - and I've had enough of it.

*Never* says something **doesn't happen**. It doesn't say when, so we don't put *never* at the start or end of the sentence.
> He **never** goes out. ≈ He **doesn't** go out.
> - (never is stronger, doesn't is softer)
