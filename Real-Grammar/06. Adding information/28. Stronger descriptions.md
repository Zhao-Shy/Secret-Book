# Stronger descriptions
intensifiers and mitigators

## very/really
We use *very* to make basic descriptions stronger.

![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/very%20or%20really%2001.png)

We use *really* to give words more emphasize.

We emphasize **descriptions** and make them stronger.
> That dog is ***really*** big. = That dog is **very** big.
> - *Really* or *very* can be used in this situation.
> - *Really* comes from *real*. What we are describing is real, not imaginary.
> - ![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/very%20or%20really%2002.png)

We also use *really* to give **verbs** and **strong descriptions** more emphasis.
||||
|--|-|-|
|I **really** enjoyed it.|It's **really** great.|It's **really** very simple.|
|*Enjoyed* is a **verb**.|*Great* is a **strong description**.|*Very simple* is a **strong description** because is uses *very*.|

We use *really* to make different parts of the sentence stronger.
> You are **really beautiful**.
> - Comparing: more beautiful than other beautiful people.
>
> You **really are** beautiful.
> - Saying the truth: Your beauty **is** real. I'm not making it up.
>
> You **really are really beautiful**.
> - We can even use really twice. However, once is usually enough.

## not very/not really
*Very* or *really* often have a similar meaning in positive sentences, but in negative sentences, *very* and *really* have different meanings.
|||
|-|-|
|When we say something is *not good*, we are saying it is *bad*.|We use *not very* to make softer negative descriptions. Something that is *not very good* is *ok* or *bad*.|
|![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/not%20very%20or%20not%20really%2001.png)|![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/not%20very%20or%20not%20really%2002.png)|

We use *not really* when something is **not true**.

![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/not%20very%20or%20not%20really%2003.png)

We also use *not really* to say no in a **softer** way.
|||
|-|-|
|A: Do you like olives?|A: Do you like olives?|
|B: No, **I don't**.|B: No, **not really**.|
|*This can be a little strong.*|*This is softer.*|

We say *really don't** emphasize the fact that we **don't** do something.
> A: Here have some olives.
> B: No, thank you. I **really don't** like them.
> - This is very strong. We are emphasizing **don't**.

### Practice
Complete the sentences with *really* or *very*. There may be more than one answer. When can we use either one?
1. The movie was ____ fantastic.
2. It's ____ hot today.
3. I don't ____ like dogs.
4. We ____ had a great time.
5. Yesterday morning was cold, but it wasn't ____ cold this morning.
6. He drives ____ slowly.

## fairly/pretty/quite/rather
We also add *fairly, pretty, quite* or *rather*. When we use these words **information** is very important. They don't have strong meanings so we use <u>word stress</u> to make descriptions stronger or weaker.

When we <u>stress</u> a word the vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u) becomes clearer, longer and has a higher pitch. We de-stress other words by making the vowel sound less clear, shorter and lower pitch.

![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/fairly%20or%20pretty%20or%20quite%20or%20rather%2001.png)

![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/fairly%20or%20pretty%20or%20quite%20or%20rather%2002.png)

### Which one should I use?
It doesn't matter if you use *fairly, pretty, quite* or *rather*. It is personal preference.

*Pretty* is considered more informal.

It's not what you say, but **how** you say it.

### Why do we use these words?
These words are also used in other situations.

Something that is *fair* is **reasonable**, or ok.
> ![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/fairly%20or%20pretty%20or%20quite%20or%20rather%2003.png)
>
> What do you think about her decison?
> - I think it's **fair**.
> - (reasonable, balanced, even, ok)

> It's **fairly** <u>good</u>.
> - It is actually **good**! I didn't expect it to be good, but to be fair, it is good.
>
> It's **<u>fairly</u>** good.
> - It isn't very good, but it is ok. It is fair to say it is good.

Something that is *pretty* stands out from other things.

*Pretty* is very shallow in meaning, we are only talking about what is **obvious**.
> ![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/fairly%20or%20pretty%20or%20quite%20or%20rather%2004.png)
>
> He thinks the woman in the middle is **pretty**.
> - She stands out because of her looks.

> It's **pretty** <u>good</u>.
> - It is **good** and stands out more than other good things.
>
> It's **<u>pretty</u>** good.
> - The **obvious part** is good, I'm not sure about the rest.

We use *quite* to refer to the **whole** thing.
> ![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/fairly%20or%20pretty%20or%20quite%20or%20rather%2005.png)
>
> How was the party?
>
> It was **quite** <u>good</u>.
> - (as a whole: good people, music, food etc.)

> It's **quite** <u>good</u>.
> - It is **good** as a whole.
>
> It's **<u>quite</u>** good.
> - Some aspects are less than good, but when you consider it as a **whole** it is good.

We also use *quite* with nouns.
> That's **quite** an achievement.
> - Considering all parts, it is a great achievement.

*Rather* is used to **compare** something to another thing. We talk about what we like more.
> ![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/fairly%20or%20pretty%20or%20quite%20or%20rather%2006.png)
>
> I'd **rather** not go. ('d = would)
> - I think not going is a better option than going.

> It's **rather** <u>good</u>.
> - It is **good**, compared to other similar things.
>
> It's **<u>rather</u>** good.
> - **Compared to some things**, it's good, but not really what I'd call good.

---

## such/so
We use *such* to say something is a perfect example of what we are talking about.
> That is ***such*** *a big dog*.
> - It is what we understand *a big dog* to be. This dog fits the definition of *big dog* perfectly.
> - ![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/such%20or%20so%2001.png)

We use *so* to connect something with what has previously been understood.

We use *so* before descriptions.
> That dog is ***so*** *big*.
> - It is what we understand *big* to be, for a dog. This dog fits the definition of *big* perfectly.
> - ![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/such%20or%20so%2002.png)

Using *so* or *such* is stronger than using *very* or *really*.

![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/such%20or%20so%2003.png)

There are many ways we describe things.
|Subject|Verb|*Object/Description*|
|-|-|-|
|It|'s|**so hot**.|
|It|'s|**such a hot day**.|
|It|'s|**very hot**.|
|It|'s|**a very hot day**.|
|It|'s|**really hot**.|
|It|'s|**a really hot day**.|
> *We use <u>word stress</u> to make descriptions stronger.*

### Practice
Make these sentences stronger using *so* or *such*.

**Example**: We had <u>such</u> a great time.
1. You're lucky to have ____ good friends.
2. He is ____ generous.
3. I've been waiting ____ long.
4. My grandfather is ____ ole.
5. She is ____ a comedian.
6. Have you ever heard ____ an amazing singer?
7. We have ____ much to talk about.

## enough/too
We use *enough* to say we have reached a good level. We use *too* to say something is excessive.
> I've had **enough** to eat.
>
> *I've reached my limit.*
>
> *I don't want to eat any more.*
>
> ![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/enough%20or%20too%2001.png)

![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/enough%20or%20too%2002.png)

|||
|-|-|
|*Too* is so strong that it is **negative**.|We use *not enough* when something is below a certain level.|
|We played our best but the other team was **too** good.|We didn't play well **enough**.|
|*It was bad for us - we couldn't win.*|*If we had played above a certain level we would have won.*|
|I wanted to buy some new shoes but they were **too** expensive.|I wanted to buy some new shoes but I didn't have **enough** money.|
|*The price was so high it was bad. I couldn't buy the shoes.*|*It was bad for me. If I had more money I would have bought them.*|
|![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/enough%20or%20too%2003.png)|![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/enough%20or%20too%2004.png)|

### Practice
Circle the correct answers.

**Example**: Do you have a really big box? This box (is too big) (is big enough) (isn't big enough).
1. I have to be back at work at 2:00, so we have (too much) (enough) time for lunch.
2. I wanted to buy some coffee, but the line was (too long) (long enough) so I went home.

## not that/not so/not such/not too
*That* refers to something which is not at the same place and time as the speaker.

We use *that* to refer to what we thought in the past.

![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/not%20that%20or%20not%20so%20or%20not%20such%20or%20not%20too%2001.png)

We use *so* to connect something with what has previously been understood. *Not so big* and *not that big* are similar expressions that can be used in the same situation. We say something isn't as big as we though it would be.

![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/not%20that%20or%20not%20so%20or%20not%20such%20or%20not%20too%2002.png)

We use *such* in the same way as *so*, but say what the thing is.

![](./28.%20Stronger%20descriptions/not%20that%20or%20not%20so%20or%20not%20such%20or%20not%20too%2003.png)

*Too* has a negative meaning. When we use *not* with *too* it becomes **positive**.
> A: How was your lunch?
> 
> B: **Not too** bad.
> - = It was ok / good.

> A: Would you like some more?
> 
> B: Yes, ok. **Not too** much though.
> - = Just a good amount.
