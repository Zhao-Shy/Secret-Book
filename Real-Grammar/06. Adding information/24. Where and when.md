## adding a place
There are many words we can use to say **where** something is or happens.

We often simply refer to a place. *(See page 4.)*

![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20place%2001.png)

Sometimes we might want to say where something is, based on where something else is.

*In front of, behind, above, below, over, under, apart* and *away* focus on **distance** and **direction**.
|From me|From the center of the Earth|From me|
|---|---|---|

*Below* and *under* have similar meanings but they are used differently.

> The same applies for *above* and *over*: I held the umbrella **over** her. We looked at the building **above**.

These words can be used to emphasize **distance**...
|Subject|Verb|*Distance*|*Direction*|
|---|---|---|---|
|They|sat|two rows|**in front of** the band.|
|We|were|100 meters|**above** the valley.|

...or just say the **direction** from one thing to the next.
> They sat in front of the band.
>
> We were above the valley.

We can use *away* to show **distance**...
> The beach is **one kilometer** away *(from here)*.

...or say something or someone is **not here**.
> Sorry, he's away today. *(He's not here.)*

*By, beside, between, near* and *opposite* express other relationships in space *(not distance)*.

> We live **by** *the mountains*.
> - *The mountains can be used to locate our house. (For more on **by** see page 208)*

We also use expressions with *to* and *from*.

### Practice
Look at the picture and complete the sentences. There may be more than one answer.

![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20place%2019.png)

    A: Do you know who everyone is?
    B: Hannah is sitting ____ the door. Patrick is sitting ____ the window. Phil is sitting ____ Patrick. Courtney is sitting ____ Hannah.
    A: When does Phil go on leave?
    B: I'm not sure, check the calendar ____ Courtney.
    A: Have you seen my keys?
    B: That could be them ____ the table, ____ Patrick and Phil.

When we talk about places we often talk about **movement**.

We use *from* and *to* to talk about origins and destinations.

> ![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20place%2015.png)
>
> I went **from** the bank **to** the supermarket.

We use *up* and *down* to talk about movement in relation to the Earth. We use *back* to talk about the **direction** of movement in relation to where the subject was before.

|The plane flew **up**.|We went **donw**.|They went **back**. *(to where they were)*|

We use *in, out (of), through, on, off, across* to talk about movement involving something else. If the listener knows what we are talking about, we don't need to say what the something else is.

We can add more information, such as a destination.

|I|walked|out *(of the house)*|to the garden.|
|The payment|went|through|to the bank.|

|We|walked|across *(the road)*|to the bakery.|
> *Into (in + to)* and *onto (on + to)* are so common that they have become one word.

We use *forward, backwards* and *sideways* to talk about movement in relation to the subject.

## adding a time
We use *when* to ask about **time**.

There are many words we can use to say when something happens.

We often simply refer to a time. *(See page 6.)*
