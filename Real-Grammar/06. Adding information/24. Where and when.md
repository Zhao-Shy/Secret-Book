prepositions of place, prepositions of time

## adding a place
There are many words we can use to say **where** something is or happens.

We often simply refer to a place. *(See page 4.)*

![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20place%2001.png)

Sometimes we might want to say where something is, based on where something else is.

*In front of, behind, above, below, over, under, apart* and *away* focus on **distance** and **direction**.
|From me|From the center of the Earth|From me|
|---|---|---|

*Below* and *under* have similar meanings but they are used differently.

> The same applies for *above* and *over*: I held the umbrella **over** her. We looked at the building **above**.

These words can be used to emphasize **distance**...
|Subject|Verb|*Distance*|*Direction*|
|---|---|---|---|
|They|sat|two rows|**in front of** the band.|
|We|were|100 meters|**above** the valley.|

...or just say the **direction** from one thing to the next.
> They sat in front of the band.
>
> We were above the valley.

We can use *away* to show **distance**...
> The beach is **one kilometer** away *(from here)*.

...or say something or someone is **not here**.
> Sorry, he's away today. *(He's not here.)*

*By, beside, between, near* and *opposite* express other relationships in space *(not distance)*.

We also use expressions with *to* and *from*.

### Practice
Look at the picture and complete the sentences. There may be more than one answer.

![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20place%2019.png)

    A: Do you know who everyone is?
    B: Hannah is sitting ____ the door. Patrick is sitting ____ the window. Phil is sitting ____ Patrick. Courtney is sitting ____ Hannah.

    B: I'm not sure, check the calendar ____ Courtney.
    A: Have you seen my keys?
    B: That could be them ____ the table, ____ Patrick and Phil.

When we talk about places we often talk about **movement**.

We use *from* and *to* to talk about origins and destinations.

> ![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20place%2015.png)
>
> I went **from** the bank **to** the supermarket.

We use *up* and *down* to talk about movement in relation to the Earth. We use *back* to talk about the **direction** of movement in relation to where the subject was before.

|The plane flew **up**.|We went **donw**.|They went **back**. *(to where they were)*|

We use *in, out (of), through, on, off, across* to talk about movement involving something else. If the listener knows what we are talking about, we don't need to say what the something else is.

We can add more information, such as a destination.

We use *forward, backwards* and *sideways* to talk about movement in relation to the subject.

## adding a time
We use *when* to ask about **time**.

There are many words we can use to say when something happens.

We often simply refer to a time. *(See page 6.)*

![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20time%2001.png)

The words *ago, away* and *apart* are used with *be* to say the **distance** between fixed times.

![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20time%2002.png)

|Subject|Verb|*Time*||
|---|---|---|---|
||(be)|***Distance***|***Direction***|
|The party|was|a week|**ago**.|
|The show|is|just minutes|**away**.|
|Our birthdays|are|four days|**apart**.|

We also use *ago* with other verbs. *Ago* says when something happened in the past in relation to now.
> We went shopping two days **ago**.
>
> I met her a week **ago**.

*Before* and *after* are used to show the **order** things happen.

![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20time%2003.png)

*Before* and *after* can be used to say when by adding a **distance**...
|Subject|Verb|*Time*||
|---|---|---|---|
||(be)|***Distance***|***Direction***|
|I|left|two hours|**before** him.|
|We|stayed|a long time|**after** the meeting.|

...or just say the **order** things happen.
> I left before him. *(I left before they left).*
>
> We stayed after the meeting.

We also use *before* when we use *have* and the *-en form* referring to **before this time**.
> A: Have you eaten at this restaurant **before**?
> - B: No, I haven't been here **before**.

Some words express a relationship between points in time *(for example: start/finish/now)*.

*For* is used to specify a length of time (a duration).

![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20time%2004.png)

*Since* says when something started and *unitil/till* says when something finishes.

![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20time%2005.png)

We also use *since* to **emphasize** how much time has passed since an event, and *until/till* to **emphasize** how much time there is until an event. We add a **distance**. These sentences use *be*.

![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20time%2006.png)

We use *in* to say something finishes at a point in time after now. We use *by* to say something finishes before another point in time.

![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20time%2007.png)

*Ago* is used to refer to the past and *in* is used to be refer to the future in similar situations.
|||
|---|---|
|We use *ago* to express **distance** from the present-future.|We use *in* to express a **point** of time in the present-future.|
|![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20time%2008.png)|![](./24.%20Where%20and%20when/adding%20a%20time%2009.png)|
|I saw him *three days* **ago**.|I see him **in three days**.|

### Practice
Choose the best words to complete the sentences.
1. I'm at home. I'll be here (by) (until) 3PM.
2. She's moving to the city in January. I'm moving two months (ago) (before).
3. I'm still at work, but I'll be home (after) (until) 7 o'clike.
4. I played baseball (two days ago) (in two days).
5. I've played baseball (since) (until) I was three.
6. He played professional football (since) (until) he was 35.

We use *when* to ask about **times**.
|*When*||Subject|Verb|Object/Description|*Time*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**When**|**do**|the Smiths|eat?|||
|||*They*|*eat*||in the afternoon.|
|**When**|**does**|Robert|have|breakfast?||

|**When**|**did**|Patricia|play|soccer?||

|||*I*|*'m*|*free*|on Friday.|
|**When**|**are**|yuo|working||this week?|
|||*I*|*'m working*||on Friday.|

We don't need to say the words in *italics*. They have already been said so we can leave them out.

We use *how long* to ask about **periods of time**.
|*How long*||Subject|Verb|Object/Description|*Time*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**How long**|**have**|the Smiths|lived|here?||
|||*They*|*'ve lived*|*here*|for three years.|

|||*He*|*'s been waiting*||since 10AM.|
