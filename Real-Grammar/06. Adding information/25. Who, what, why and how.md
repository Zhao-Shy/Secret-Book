# Who, what, why and how
indirect objects and prepositional phrases

## adding a recipient
Some verbs suggest that a person **gets** or **receives** the object. This person is the recipient.

We add the recipient like this: 
|Subject|Verb|*Recipient*|Object|Place/Time|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|gave|**Julie**|a present.||Julie got the present.|
|He|bought|**me**|lunch.||I got lunch.|
|I|teach|**kids**|English|on Mondays.|The kids get an English lesson.|
|They|sent|**us**|a letter.||We got a letter.|
> These sentences also make sense if we leave the *recipient* out. Adding it adds more information.
>
> We are saying **who** or **what** gets it.

A person can be the recipient of their own action.
|Subject|Verb|*Recipient*|Object|Place/Time|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|gave|**ourselves**|a present.||We got the present.|
|He|bought|**himself**|lunch.||He got lunch.|
|I|teach|**myself**|English|on Mondays.|I get an English lesson.|
|They|sent|**themselves**|a letter.||They got a letter.|

## to: adding a destination
![](./25.%20Who,%20what,%20why%20and%20how/to%20-%20adding%20a%20destination%2001.png)

When someone or something moves we add a destination with *to*. The destination can be a place, person, thing or event.
> I went **to sechool** (place)
>
> I went **to the desk**. (thing)
>
> I went ** to the doctor**. (person)
>
> I went **to a meeting**. (event)

The **object** moves to the destination.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*Destination*|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|took|my son|**to the doctor**.|My son moved (I did too).|
|I|sent|a letter|**to the office**.|The letter moved.|

When there is no object the **subject** moves to the destinaton.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*Destination*|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|walked||**to the shops**.|I moved.|

We can add *to* to show the object **moves** from the subject to the destination.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*Destination*|Place/Time|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|gave|a present|**to Julie**.||The present moved from us to Julie.|
|He|passed|the ball|**to me**.|The ball moved from him to me.|
|I|teach|English|**to kids**|on Mondays.|Knowledge moves from me to the kids.|
|They|sent|a package|**to us**.||The package moved from them to us.|
> These sentences make sense if we leave the *to destination* part out. Adding it adds more information. We are saying **where** it goes. We talk about something moving from A to B.

In some situations one way is more natural and makes more sense.
|||
|---|---|
|We use *to* and a *destination* to talk about **movement**.|We use a *recipient* to talk about someone **getting** something.|
|![](./25.%20Who,%20what,%20why%20and%20how/to%20-%20adding%20a%20destination%2002.png)|![](./25.%20Who,%20what,%20why%20and%20how/to%20-%20adding%20a%20destination%2003.png)|

Often, both ways fit the same situation. We talk about **movement** or someone **getting** something.
|||
|---|---|
|He gave a present **to her** on her birthday.|He gave **her** a present on her birthday.|
|The present went from him **to her**.|He gave it. **She got** it.|
|![](./25.%20Who,%20what,%20why%20and%20how/to%20-%20adding%20a%20destination%2004.png)|![](./25.%20Who,%20what,%20why%20and%20how/to%20-%20adding%20a%20destination%2005.png)|

### Practice
Complete the sentences with the words in brackets and *to* when required.

There may be more than one answer. Leave one space blank.

**Example**: 
> (her grandmother) She sent <u>her grandmother</u> a letter ____.
> - or She sent ____ a letter <u>to her grandmother</u>.

1. (me) The boss gave ____ a raise ____.

4. (the committee) She announced ____ her decision ____.
5. (him) The meal cost ____ $100 ____.
6. (Wendy) A: Where is your skateboard? B: I sold ____ it ____.

When someone or something moves we add a source with *from*. The source can be a place, person, thing or event.

> I come **from Australia**. *(place)*
> 
> Peaches come **from a tree**. *(thing)*
>
> I got a prescription **from the doctor**. *(person)*
>
> I have the notes **from the meeting**. *(event)*

When we expect the destination or source to be a **place** we ask with *where*.
|*Where*||Subject|Verb|Object|*Destination/Source|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Where**|did|you|walk||*to*?|
|||*I*|*walked*||*to* **the shops**.|
|**Where**|did|you|get|the table?*||
|||*I*|*got*|*it*|from a friend.|
> \* If we don't know, we often assume it is from a place *(probably a  shop)*. If we expect it to be from a person, we ask: 'Who did you get the table from?'

|*Who*||Subject|Verb|Object|*Destination/Source|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Who**|did|you|get|the present|**from**?|
|||*I*|*got*|*it*|*from* **Julie**.|
|**Who**|did|he|pass|the ball|**to**?|
|||*He*|*passed*|*it*|*to* **me**.|

When we expect the destination or source to be a **thing**, we ask with *what*.
|*What*||Subject|Verb|Object|*Destination/Source|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**What**|did|she|connect|the hose|**to**?|
|||*She*|*connected*|*it*|*to* **the tap**.|

### Practice

## for: making connections
We use *for* to explain things by making connections.

We use *for* to explain **how long** things happen, showing the **length** of time connecting when something starts and finishes. *(See page 199.)*
> I lived in England **for** four years.
>
> ![](./25.%20Who,%20what,%20why%20and%20how/for%20-%20making%20connections%2001.png)

We also use *for* to connect an **action** with a **reason** why we do the action.

> ![](./25.%20Who,%20what,%20why%20and%20how/for%20-%20making%20connections%2002.png)

|Subject|*Verb*|Object/Description|*Reason*|
|---|---|---|---|
|We|**have**|food|**for dinner**.|
|She|**bought**|a card|**for her mother**.|
|He|**got**|some socks|**for his birthday**.|
|I|**ran**||**for my life**.|

Sometimes a *recipient, to* or *for* can be used in the same situation. The meaning is slightly different.
> I sang **you** a song.
> - Recipient: you. You got my gift of music.
>
> I sang a song **to you**.
> - Destination: The song went from me to you.
>
> I sang a song **for you**.
> - Reason: I sang it because I thought you'd like it.

Sometimes they have very different meanings.
> I'll send **you** it.
> - Recipient: you. **You** will receive it.
>
> I'll send it **to you**.
> - Destination: you. **You** will receive it.
>
> I'll send it **for you**.
> - Reason: you. You want it sent. I'll send it. **Someone else** will receive it.

### Practice
Complete the sentences with the words in brackets. Use *for* or *to* when needed.

There may be more than one answer. Leave one space blank.

**Example**:
> (him) I booked ____ the flights <u>for him</u>.

1. (us) They cooked ____ dinner ____.
2. (you) I wrote ____ a song ____.
3. (me) This is really heavy, could you take ____ my bag ____, please?

5. (me) They opened ____ the door ____.
6. (her) I gave ____ a hug ____.
7. (my friends) I send ____ messages ____ on their birthdays.

### Another reason for using *to* or *for*:
With longer expressions we use *to* and *for* to make it easier for the listener to follow.
> They gave bonuses **to** staff who had been working there for more than 10 years.
> - The listener takes the important information into account while they reveive more information.
>
> They gave staff who had been working here for more than 10 years bonuses.
> - This is harder to follow.

We form questions about a recipient with *to* and *for*. This makes things clearer for the listener.
|||
|---|---|
|A: I gave her a hug.|A: I bought him lunch.|
|B: Who did you give a hug **to**?|B: Who did you buy lunch **for**?|
|A: Arianna.|A: Jack.|

### Practice
Complete the sentences with the words in brackets. Use *for* or *to* when needed. There may be more than one answer. Leave one space blank.

1. (the guests who attended our wedding) We gave ____ the cake ____.

### Other ways to add a reason
We can also add a reason with *to* and a **verb** to describe the next thing to happen in sequence. *(See page 82.)*
> I bought some water **to drink**.

Or with *because* and another **subject, verb** and **object** stating why.
> I bought some water **because I was thirsty**.

We can say the reason first. We use *so* to refer what has previously been understood. The listener has understood the reason because the speaker has just said it.
> **I was thirsty so** I bought some water.

We use *why* to ask for a **reason**.

We can answer using *for* to connect an action with a reason.
|*Why*||Subject|Verb|Object|*Reason*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Why**|did|she|buy|a card?||
|||*She*|*bought*|*it*|**for her mother**.|
|**Why**|did|he|get|some socks?|
|||*He*|*got*|*them*|**for his birthday**.|

We can also say why with *to* and a verb, *because* or *so*.
> Why did you buy that chocolate?
> - *I bought it* **for** my girlfriend. *(for + person/thing)*
> - *I bought it* **to** give to my girlfriend. *(to + verb)*
> - *I bought it* **because** my girlfriend likes it. *(because + statement)*
> - My girlfriend likes it ***so** I bought it. (statement + so)*

We can also ask with *who* or *what*.
|*Who/What*||Subject|Verb|Object|*Reason*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Who**|did|she|buy|a card|**for**?|
|||*She*|*bought*|*it*|*for* **her mother**.|
|**What**|did|he|get|some socks|**for**?*|
|||*He*|*got*|*them*|*for* **his birthday**.|
> \* *What...for* can be used instead of *why* when speaking casually.
