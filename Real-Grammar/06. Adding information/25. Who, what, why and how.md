# Who, what, why and how
indirect objects and prepositional phrases

## adding a recipient
Some verbs suggest that a person **gets** or **receives** the object. This person is the recipient.

We add the recipient like this: 
|Subject|Verb|*Recipient*|Object|Place/Time|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|gave|**Julie**|a present.||Julie got the present.|
|He|bought|**me**|lunch.||I got lunch.|
|I|teach|**kids**|English|on Mondays.|The kids get an English lesson.|
|They|sent|**us**|a letter.||We got a letter.|
> These sentences also make sense if we leave the *recipient* out. Adding it adds more information.
>
> We are saying **who** or **what** gets it.

A person can be the recipient of their own action.
|Subject|Verb|*Recipient*|Object|Place/Time|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|gave|**ourselves**|a present.||We got the present.|
|He|bought|**himself**|lunch.||He got lunch.|
|I|teach|**myself**|English|on Mondays.|I get an English lesson.|
|They|sent|**themselves**|a letter.||They got a letter.|

## to: adding a destination
![](./25.%20Who,%20what,%20why%20and%20how/to%20-%20adding%20a%20destination%2001.png)

When someone or something moves we add a destination with *to*. The destination can be a place, person, thing or event.
> I went **to sechool** (place)
>
> I went **to the desk**. (thing)
>
> I went ** to the doctor**. (person)
>
> I went **to a meeting**. (event)

The **object** moves to the destination.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*Destination*|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|took|my son|**to the doctor**.|My son moved (I did too).|
|I|sent|a letter|**to the office**.|The letter moved.|

When there is no object the **subject** moves to the destinaton.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*Destination*|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|walked||**to the shops**.|I moved.|

We can add *to* to show the object **moves** from the subject to the destination.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*Destination*|Place/Time|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|gave|a present|**to Julie**.||The present moved from us to Julie.|
|He|passed|the ball|**to me**.|The ball moved from him to me.|
|I|teach|English|**to kids**|on Mondays.|Knowledge moves from me to the kids.|
|They|sent|a package|**to us**.||The package moved from them to us.|
> These sentences make sense if we leave the *to destination* part out. Adding it adds more information. We are saying **where** it goes. We talk about something moving from A to B.
