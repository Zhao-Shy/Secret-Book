# Comparing
comparatives and superlatives

## -er than
We add *-er* to adjectives to compare things to other things.

![](./29.Comparing/-er%20than%2001.png)

|Subject|Verb|*Description (comparing)*|||
|--|-|-|-|-|
|||***Description***|***than***|***Thing***|
|It|'s|clod**er**|than|ice.|
|She|looks|old**er**|than|you.|
|We|ran|fast**er**|than|usual.|

We don't add *-er* to longer words, we put *more* first. There are words with two syllables or more.

We also add *more* with adverbs ending in *-ly*.
|Subject|Verb|*Description (comparing)*||||
|--|-|-|-|-|-|
|||**Amount**|***Description***|***than***|***Thing***|
|It|'s|**more**|delicious|than|apple pie.|
|He|looks|**more**|handsome|than|I thought.|
|She|finished|**more**|quickly|than|before.*|
> \* We also use the adjective form in this situation: She finished **quicker** than before. *(See page 234.)*

However, for adjectives ending in *-y* we change the *y* to *i* and add *-er*. *(even if they have two or more syllables)*
|Subject|Verb|*Description (comparing)*|||
|--|-|-|-|-|
|||***Description***|***than***|***Thing***|
|These towels|are|dr**ier**|than|those ones.|
|He|looks|happ**ier**|than|a bodybuilder directing traffic.|
|English|is|eas**ier**|than|I thought.|

When we compare **good** things, we use *better*. When we compare **bad** things we use *worse*.
|Subject|Verb|*Description (comparing)*|||State|
|--|-|-|-|-|-|
|||***Description***|***than***|***Thing***||
|This mother's sales|are|**worse**|than|last month's.|*(bad)*|
|It|'s|**better**|than|we expected.|*(good)*|

We can also describe the object of the sentence.
|Subject|Verb|*Description (comparing)*||||
|--|-|-|-|-|-|
|||***Description***|***Object***|***than***|***Thing***|
|I|have|smaller|feet|than|my sister.|
|She|drives|fancier|cars|than|me.|
|He|cooks|better|curry|than|pasta.|

We use different words when comparing amounts.

We leave out the words in *gray* when they are obvious in the situation.
|Subject|Verb|*Description (comparing)*||||State|
|--|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||***Amount***|***Thing***|***than***|***Thing***||
|I|'ve got|**more**|*rice*|than|I wanted.|*(much)*|
|They|bought|**more**|*apples*|than|me.|*(many)*|
|We|'re spending|**less**|*money*|than|we expected.|*(little)*|
|There|are|**fewer**|*(sheep)*|than|300 sheep on our farm.*|*(few)*|
> \* We don't say *sheep* twice. We usually add it after the number.

We can leave out the *than...* part when we are comparing something to what usually happens or how it is now or was before.
> I would be there **sooner** *than I will actually be there* if the traffic wasn't so bad.
>
> It usually takes three days but we are very busy this week so it might take **longer** *than usual*.
>
> Your little girl is getting **bigger** *than she was before*.
>
> It costs **more** *than it did before/than we thought*.

We add *much, a lot* or *way* to make these comparisons stronger. Which word you use is personal preference. *A lot* and *way* are more casual.
> It's **much** more expensive than I thought. It's **a lot** better than I thought. I'm **way** happier now.

### Practice

## as...as...
We use *as* to say that something about two things is the same.
> She is **as tall as** her brother.
> - She and her brother are the same height. They are equally tall.
> - ![](./29.Comparing/as...%20as...%2001.png)

We sometimes exaggerate a little.

![](./29.Comparing/as...%20as...%2002.png)

We compare measurable descriptions, including times and quantities.
|Subject|Verb|*Comparison (Description, Time, Amount etc.)*|||||State|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||***Amount***|***as***|***Description***|***as***|***Thing/Subject, Verb etc.***|
|It|'s||**as**|cold|**as**|ice.|
|I|came||**as**|soon|**as**|I could.|(time)|
|This soup|costs|half|**as**|much|**as**|it did before.|(quantity)|

When we compare things we can add an **amount**.
> This soup costs **half** as much as it did before.
> - *(before = $48, now = $24)*
>
> Your luggage is **twice** as heavy as mine.
> - *(your luggage = 40Kg, my luggage = 20Kg)*

We use *as long as* to show that I will keep my promise for the length of time my conditions are met.

![](./29.Comparing/as...%20as...%2003.png)

> You can go out **as long as** you're back by 10:00.
>
> I'll go **as long as** it doesn't rain.

*As long as* is often used in casual speech. We use *provided (that)* formal situations.
> You may go out **provided** *that* you are back by 10:00.

We use words like *soon, fast, quick* and *long* for time.
|Subject|Verb|Object etc.|*Time*|||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||||***as***|***Description***|***as***|***Thing/Subject, Verb etc.***|
|I|'ll be|there||as|**soon**|as|possible.|
||Stay||*for*|as|**long**|as|you like.|

*Much, many, few* and *little* may did information to an object. They tell us the **quantity**.
|Subject|Verb|*Object*||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||***as***|***Description***|***Thing***|***as***|***Thing/Subject, Verb etc.***|
|You|should eat|as|**much**|fruit|as|possible.|
|I|took|as|**little**|luggage|as|I could.|
||Take|as|**many**|cookies|as|you like.|

We don't need to say obvious things. These things are obvious because of the situation.
> I took **as little** *luggage* **as** I could *take*.
>
> Take **as many** *cookies* **as** you like.

We may add a **number** to give a **quantity** with *much, many, few* and *little*. We do this for **emphasis**.
> There are **as few as** 300 Sumatran tigers left in the wild.
> - (emphasis: this is a small number)
>
> **As much as** 10Kg of chocolate was eaten at the party.
> - (emphasis: this is a large amount)

*As much* can also be used to add a time. It tell us it happens **often**.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*Time*||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
||||***as***|***Description***|***as***|***Thing/Subject, Verb etc.***|
|You|should eat|fruit|as|**much**|as|possible.|
|I|study|English|as|**often**|as|I can.|

## like
In previous sections we have used *like* as a verb.

When we like something, we are happy with that person or thing.
|||
|-|-|
|He **likes** his father.|He **doesn't like** his father.|
|*Describing what he thinks: He is happy having his father in his life.*|*Describing what he thinks: He is happy not having his father in his life.*|
|![](./29.Comparing/like%2001.png)|![](./29.Comparing/like%2002.png)|

|Subject|*Verb*|Object|
|-|-|-|
|He|**likes**|his father.|
|She|**doesn't like**|coffee.|

We also use *like* in another way. When we compare things we often use *like* to say things are **similar**. *Not like* is often used to say things are **different**.

![](./29.Comparing/like%2003.png)
|||
|-|-|
|He's **like** his father.|He **isn't like** his father.|
|*Describing him: He and his father are similar.*|*Describing him: He and his father are different.*|
|![](./29.Comparing/like%2004.png)|![](./29.Comparing/like%2005.png)|

|Subject|Verb|Object|*like*|
|-|-|-|-|
|He|'s||like his father.|
|She|plays|the piano|like her mother.|

We use *alike* when the things we are comparing are the subject.
|Subject|Verb|Object|*alike*|
|-|-|-|-|
|He and his father|are||alike.|

Sometimes things that seem unrelated at first are actually similar in some way.
> "Minds are **like** parachutes, they only function when open." - Thomas Dewar

We use *be (am/is/are)* to describe something.
> She **is** a hard worker.
>
> He **is** a footballer.

We use *like* with verbs describing senses. We sense that these things are similar. The description might fit, but we are not 100% certain.
> She **seems like** a hard worker.
> - I think she could be a hard worker, but I am not certain.
>
> It **feels like** it's going to rain.
> - I don't know if it will rain, but I have the feeling.
>
> He **looks like** a footballer.
> - He could be a footballer based on how he looks, but I'm not certain.
>
> It **sounds like** a good movie.
> - I think it could be a good movie based on what people are saying. I'm not certain, I haven't seen it.

We can use any verbs describing senses in this way including *seem, look, sound, feel, taste* and *smell*.

We use *feel like* when we have a feeling that leads us to doing something.

![](./29.Comparing/like%2006.png)

|Subject|*Verb (feel)*|*like*|
|-|-|-|
|He|**feels**|**like dancing**.|
|She|**feels**|**like *drinking* a cup of tea**.|
> She **feel like** a cup of tea.
> - We don't need to say 'drinking'. It is obvious that she'll drink it.
>
> I **feel like** a sandwich.
> - We don't need to say 'eating'. It is obvious that I'll eat it.

### Practice

## like/as
Sometimes expressions with *like* or *as* can be used in the same situation.
|||
|-|-|
|We use *as* to say things are **the same**.|We use *like* to say things are **similar**.|
|![](./29.Comparing/like%20or%20as%2001.png)|![](./29.Comparing/like%20or%20as%2002.png)|
> Sam was late, **as** we expected.
> - What we expected and what happened were the **same**.
>
> Sam was late, **like** we expected.
> - The events unfolded in a **similar** way to what we expected.

We use *such as* to give examples. We can also use *like*.
> Water sports **such as** surfing, swimming and scuba diving, are popular in Australia.
> - The **same** sports listed are examples of popular water sports in Australia.
>
> Water sports **like** surfing, swimming and scuba diving, are popular in Australia.
> - Sports **similar** to and including the sports listed are popular water sports in Australia.

We use *as... as...* to say things are the same in some way. We also use *like* to say things are similar. 

However, using *like* may have a different meaning.
> That dog is **as big as** a horse
> - The dog and a horse are the **same** size (**both big**).
>
> That dog is big **like** a horse.
> - That dog and a horse are **similar**. They are **both big**.
>
> She's **as tall as** her brother.
> - They are the **same** height. (Example: she is 150cm, he is also 150cm. In this example, she and her brother are **not tall**. We compare them to each other.)
>
> She's tall **like** her brother.
> - They are **similar**; they are **both tall**. (For example: She is 180cm - tall for a woman, her brother is 190cm - tall for a man. They are tall compared to most people.)

We use *as if* to say things are the same in some way in predictions and hypothetical situations.

We also use *like* in these situations. We are speaking indirectly to express our opinion gently.
> It looks **as if** it's going to rain.
> - It looks the **same** as how it would look if it was going to rain.
>
> It looks **like** it's going to rain.
> - It looks **similar** to how it would look if it was going to rain.

### Which should I use?
Expressions with *as* are more common in formal and written English.

*Like* is considered more informal and often used in spoken English.

### Practice
Complete the sentences with *like* or an expression with *as*. There are may be more than one answer.
1. It looks ____ you've had a great day.
2. We often eat seafood ____ shellfish, crab and shrimp.
3. It's a hot day today, ____ the weather report said.
4. Take as much time ____ you like.
