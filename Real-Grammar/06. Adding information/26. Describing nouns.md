# Describing nouns
modifiers

## of
We add *of* to say what something is made of, contains or is part of.
|||
|---|---|
|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/of%2001.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/of%2002.png)|
|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/of%2003.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/of%2004.png)|

We also add *of* to describe the proportion or size of something.

![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/of%2005.png)

||||
|---|---|---|
|some **of** *them*|none **of** *them*|all **of** *them*|
|some **of** *my friends*|none **of** *my friends*|all (**of**) *my friends*|
|*(a small number)*|*(not one = 0%)*|*(100%)*|

We can use *all* with or without *of*.

We use *all* with *of*. We think about each person or thing in the group. *(100% = every part)*

We use *all* without *of*. We think of the group as a whole. *(100% = the whole group)*

We use *of* to add information to nouns.

*(subjects, objects, destinations, reasons, quantities, processes, times and places)*
|*Subject*|Verb|*Object*|*Place/Time/Reason etc.*|
|---|---|---|---|
|**A group of people**|meet||here on Wednesdays to discuss language.|
|I|ate|**two pieces of cake**.||
|They|climbed||to **the top of the mountain**.|
|He|bought|a gift|for **the king of the mountain**.|
|The team|won||by **a margin of 10 points**.|
|The news|spread||by **word of mouth**.|
|We|went|camping|with **a family of four**.|
|She|woke||in **the middle of the night**.|
|I|waited||on **the corner of 52nd and Broadway**.|

*Of* and *'s* can often be used in the same situation.

![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/of%2006.png)

We sometimes use *of*, we sometimes use *'s*.
> Queen Elizabeth II is **the Queen of England**.
> - In most situations, what she is (the Queen) is more important than whose queen she is (England's). 
> - She is <u>**the**</u> one and only queen.

> **A <u>friend</u> of John's** is coming to visit.
> - We use *a*. The person is **one** of **many** friends. It could be anyone.
> - The emphasize is on <u>friend</u> (what)

> **<u>John's</u> friend** is coming to visit.
> - This is more specific. We expect the listener to know who we are talking about.
> - The emphasize is no <u>John's</u>. (whose)

> He's **<u>John's</u> brother**.
> - We talk about family connections. Whose brother is important.

### Practice
Choose the best words to complete the sentences.
1. Could I have (a slice of cheese) (cheese's slice), please?
2. Who is (the President of the United States) (the United State's President)?
3. Who is (a sister of Maria's) (Maria's sister)?

---

## adding information after nouns
We use words such as *in, on, at, to* and *with* to add information to nouns too.

![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adding%20information%20after%20nouns%2001.png)

|*Subject*|Verb|*Object/Description*|*Place/Time/Reason etc.*|
|---|---|---|---|
|**A friend from high school**|works||there.|
|**The bex under my bed**|is|full of old clothes.||
|We|have|**lessons for children**.||
|They|climbed||to **the hut on the mountain**.|
|I|sent|a gift|to **my cousin in Europe**.|
|We|went|camping|with **a family with two children**.|

We can also add *to* and a destination or goal (a noun or a verb) to a noun.
> **The road to the lake** is that way.
>
> This is **the place to be**.

We often add information to more than one noun in the sentence.
> I asked **the man in the shop** if they had **any books about gardening**.
> - The **man** is in the shop. I want **books** about gardening.

We can continue to add information to the same noun or another noun. We use our common sense to tell what the added information is referring to.
> **The boy near the window with black hair** is my nephew.
> - The **boy** is near the window. The **boy** has black hair. The **boy** is my nephew.
>
> **The boy near the window with blue curtains** is my nephew.
> - The **boy** is near the window. The **window** has blue curtains. The boy is my nephew.

Sometimes what the extra information is referring to is not clear.

|Subject|Verb|*Object*||
|---|---|---|---|
|||***main noun***|***Part***|
|I|saw|a man|with binoculars.|
> I saw **a man** ***with*** *binoculars*.
> - I saw a man. The man had binoculars.

|*Subject*|Verb|Object|*Part*|
|---|---|---|---|
|I|saw|a man|with binoculars.|
> **I** saw a man ***with*** *binoculars*.
> - I used binoculars and saw a man.

Sometimes the only way to be sure is to ask the speaker to make it clear.
> "Did you have the binoculars or did the man have the binoculars?"

In most situations common sense makes it obvious.
> Anna took a photo of a monkey **with** *my phone*.
> - Anna had my phone.
> - ![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adding%20information%20after%20nouns%2002.png)
>
> Anna took a photo of a monkey **with** *my phone*.
> - The monkey had my phone. This is less likely.
> - ![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adding%20information%20after%20nouns%2004.png)

> Anna took a photo of a monkey **with** *a long tail*.
> - **The monkey** had a long tail.
> - ![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adding%20information%20after%20nouns%2003.png)
>
> Anna took a photo of a monkey **with** *a long tail*.
> - No. This is ridiculous.
> - ![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adding%20information%20after%20nouns%2005.png)

### Practice
Choose the best words to complete the sentences.

**Example**: The bag (near) (of) (with) the door is mine.
1. The president (for) (of) (with) the company has decided to retire.
2. I bought a cpu (in) (from) (of) coffee (near) (of) (with) the change (in) (from) (of) lunch.
3. Some (in) (from) (of) my coworkers go home at 4:20.

## adjectives
Some words are only used to **describe** nouns. These words are called adjectives. We often put them before nouns. These are many things we use adjectives to describe.

*Other* is the most common adjective in the English language.
|||
|---|---|
|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2001.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2002.png)|
|Other = not this one.|Another = an + other.|
|*The*: the listener knows which one.|*An*: We are talking about one of the other bananas.|
|*There are only two bananas here. We are not talking about the one we first talked about.*|*There are more bananas here.*|

There are lots of things we can describe with adjectives.
|a **small** door|an **old** door|a **green** door|
|---|---|---|
|*(size)*|*(age)*|*(color)*|
|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2003.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2004.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2005.png)|

We describe any noun in the sentence: a noun in the subject, object, time, place, reason etc.
|*Subject*|Verb|*Object*|*Place/Time/Reason etc.*|
|---|---|---|---|
|**A small group**|meets||here on Wednesdays to discuss language.|
|I|ate|**two big sandwiches**.||
|They|climbed||to **the top of the high mountain**.|
|He|bought|a gift|for **his old friend**.|
|The team|trained||for **a long time**.|
|We|live||in **a beautiful village**.|

We use adjectives to describe the subject of the sentence, often after *be*.
|Subject|Verb|*Description*|
|He|is|**thirsty**.|
|They|look|**happy**.|

Adjectives tell us how something is different from other things. Nouns tell us what something is.
> This is a ***big*** **banana**.
> - **big (adjective)**: how it is different from other bananas - not all bananas are this big.
> - **banana (noun)**: what it is.
> - ![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2006.png)

We sometimes use more than one adjective.

The adjectives we use first are the ones that give the most **obvious** or **important differences**.
> This is a ***big ripe*** **banana**.
> - When you see it, the most obvious thing it is **big**. It is also **ripe**.
> - ![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2007.png)

Adjectives that come later help describe **what** something is.
> A ***23-years-old Canadian*** **woman** won the marathon.
>
> They sat at the ***small old wooden*** **table**.
>
> Can I have the ***other little red and yellow*** **ball**?

The order depends on what is important and needs emphasizing.
> I have a **big important job** for you. 
> - We emphasize the fact that it is big.
>
> I focus on the **important little details**.
> - We emphasize the fact that they are important.

### Practice
Complete the sentences using the adjectives in brackets. Which order do you think is best?

**Example**: He was wearing a <u>dirty</u> <u>white</u> <u>cotton</u> shirt. (cotton, white, dirty)
1. I want to buy a ____ ____ ____ sofa. (large, leather, black)
2. They live in a/an ____ ____ house. (big, expensive)
3. Can I have ____ ____ slice of cake please? (thick, another)
4. They cooked us a ____ ____ ____ banquet. (7-course, delicious, Vietnamese)
5. She seems like a/an ____ ____ woman. (intelligent, young)
6. The group has just released a/an ____ ____ album. (new, amazing)
7. That little boy took the ____ ____ boy's toy car. (little, other)

We use *how* to ask for a **description** of something.
> How was your driving test?
> - *It was* difficult, but I passed.

*Adjectives* are used to describe nouns. We also use *how* with and *adjective* to ask about scale. We ask where it lies between two points.
|||||
|---|---|---|---|
|**How big** is an ant?|**How tall** is a giraffe?|**How hot** is it?|**How long** is the show?|
|Not very. It's small.|Very tall. About 6m *tall*.|It's 26°C.|It's 2 hours *long*.|
|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2008.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2009.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2010.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2011.png)|

|*How*|*Adjective*||Subject|Verb|*Object/Description*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**How**|**old**|**is**|your grandmother?|||
||||*She*|*'s*|88.|
|**How**|**long**|**is**|the Amazon River?|||
||||*It*|*'s*|6437km *long*.|
|**How**|**tall**|**do**|you|have to be to ride|the roller coaster?|
||||*You*|*have to be*|at least 120cm *tall*.|

We can describe nouns by talking about their **scale**.
|Subject|Verb|*Object*|||Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||||***Description***|***Main noun***||
|I|had|a|thirty minute|nap.|(one nap, thirty minutes long)|
|We|saw|three|seven meter|crocodiles.|(three crocodiles, seven meters long)|

We count the main noun: **a nap** and **crocodiles**. We use *a/an* or add *s*.

We don't use *s* with general descriptions, even if we are talking about more than one minute or meter. Words that come before a main noun ending in *s* tell us who it belongs to.
> I saw an American car.
> - The **car** is American.
>
> I saw an American's car.
> - The **owner** of the car is American.

Adjectives are useful when saying **which one**. We say how it is different.
|*Which*|*Object*||Subject|Verb|*Object etc.*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Which**|**cup**|**would**|you|like?||
||||*I*|*'d like*|a red one, please.|
|**Which**|**bag**|**is**|yours?|||
||||*Mine*|*is*|the leather one.|

We also use *how* to ask for a quantity.
|||
|---|---|
|**How many** bananas do you eat?|**How much** is it?|
|I eat 2 bananas every day.|It's $10.|
|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2012.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adjectives%2013.png)|
|*We can count bananas.*|*When we say **how much** and don't say what we are referring to money.*|
||*To count money we need a currency, in this example: dollars.*|

|*How*|*much/many*|*Object*||Subject|Verb|*Object/Description etc.*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**How**|**much**|**bread**|**do**|you|eat?||
|||||*I*|*eat*|a lot *of bread*.|
|||||*I*|*eat*|six slices *of bread** a day.|
|||||I|don't eat|bread.|
|**How**|**many**|**sisters**|**does**|Jeff|have?||
|||||*He*|*has*|a lot *of sisters*.|
|||||*He*|*has*|five *sisters*.|
|||||He|doesn't have|any *sisters*.|
|||||||None.|

## other ways to describe nouns
We add other words before nouns to describe what, when, where, why or how something is used or what it is a part of. These words are often other nouns.
||||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|a **car** door|a **glass** door|a **sliding** door|a **front** door|a **pet** door|an **after hours** door|a **fire** door|
|*what it is part of*|*what it is made of (material)*|*how it works (process)*|*where it is (place)*|*who/what uses it (person/thing)*|*when it is used (time)*|*why it is used (purpose)*|
|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2001.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2002.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2003.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2004.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2005.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2006.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2007.png)|

We use our common sense to understand if we are talking about a part, material, process, etc.

For example: a glass door is made of glass but a fire door is not made of fire.

There are some things that can be described serveral ways. It depends on what we are focusing on.

![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2008.png)

Sometimes these expressions have very different meanings.
|||
|---|---|
|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2009.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2010.png)|
|*The picture **belongs** to my mother. = This picture is my mother's. (emphasizing **whose** picture it is)*|*The picture **contains** an image of my mother. (emphasizing **what** the picture is of)*|
|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2011.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/other%20ways%20to%20describe%20nouns%2012.png)|
|This is **a** ***tea*cup**.|This is **a cup** ***of*** *tea*.|
|*It is a cup. Its **purpose** is holding tea. It is empty.*|*It is a cup. It **contains** tea.*|

Nouns are sometimes used together so often that they become one word. *(tea + cup = teacup)*

### Practice
Complete the sentences using the words in brackets with *of*, *'s* or by itself. There may be more than one answer. Leave one space blank.

**Example**: (the car) I left my bag in the ____ back seat <u>of the car</u>.
1. (Oliver) This looks like ____ bag ____.
2. (picture) They wrote a ____ book ____ for kids.
3. I'm thirsty. (water) Could I have a ____ glass ____, please?
4. (the pool) They swam to the ____ end ____.
5. (the company) She's ____ president ____.
6. (photo) Would you like to see my ____ album ____?

## Note: the order of adjectives
The order of adjectives depends on culture and the way people think. There isn't one correct order to use.

The expressions *big beautiful (something)* and *beautiful big (something)* are both commonly used. It depends on which one we want to emphasize.

Culture and thinking changes over time. Many modern day Americans think "bigger is better", this is reflected in language used in the United States. Americans tend to say *big beautiful*.

![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/Note%20-%20the%20order%20of%20adjectives%2001.png)

In the UK, both expressions are common, but recent trends show that *beautiful big* is used more often.

![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/Note%20-%20the%20order%20of%20adjectives%2002.png)

The general pattern that is often taught is: opinion - size - age - shape - color - origin - material - prupose. *(or something similar)*

This is generally true. We generally think that the things to the left are important characteristics.

However, adjectives don't always follow this pattern. It is up to you and what you think is important.
