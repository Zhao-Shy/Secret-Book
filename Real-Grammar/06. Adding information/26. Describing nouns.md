# Describing nouns
modifiers

## of
We add *of* to say what something is made of, contains or is part of.

|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/of%2003.png)|![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/of%2004.png)|

We also add *of* to describe the proportion or size of something.

|---|---|---|
|some **of** *them*|none **of** *them*|all **of** *them*|
|some **of** *my friends*|none **of** *my friends*|all (**of**) *my friends*|
|*(a small number)*|*(not one = 0%)*|*(100%)*|

We can use *all* with or without *of*.

We use *all* with *of*. We think about each person or thing in the group. *(100% = every part)*

We use *all* without *of*. We think of the group as a whole. *(100% = the whole group)*

We use *of* to add information to nouns.

*(subjects, objects, destinations, reasons, quantities, processes, times and places)*
|*Subject*|Verb|*Object*|*Place/Time/Reason etc.*|
|---|---|---|---|
|**A group of people**|meet||here on Wednesdays to discuss language.|
|I|ate|**two pieces of cake**.||
|They|climbed||to **the top of the mountain**.|
|He|bought|a gift|for **the king of the mountain**.|
|The team|won||by **a margin of 10 points**.|
|The news|spread||by **word of mouth**.|
|We|went|camping|with **a family of four**.|
|She|woke||in **the middle of the night**.|
|I|waited||on **the corner of 52nd and Broadway**.|

*Of* and *'s* can often be used in the same situation.

![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/of%2006.png)

We sometimes use *of*, we sometimes use *'s*.
> Queen Elizabeth II is **the Queen of England**.
> - In most situations, what she is (the Queen) is more important than whose queen she is (England's). 
> - She is <u>**the**</u> one and only queen.

> **A <u>friend</u> of John's** is coming to visit.
> - We use *a*. The person is **one** of **many** friends. It could be anyone.
> - The emphasize is on <u>friend</u> (what)

> **<u>John's</u> friend** is coming to visit.
> - This is more specific. We expect the listener to know who we are talking about.
> - The emphasize is no <u>John's</u>. (whose)

> He's **<u>John's</u> brother**.
> - We talk about family connections. Whose brother is important.

### Practice
Choose the best words to complete the sentences.
1. Could I have (a slice of cheese) (cheese's slice), please?
2. Who is (the President of the United States) (the United State's President)?
3. Who is (a sister of Maria's) (Maria's sister)?

## adding information after nouns
We use words such as *in, on, at, to* and *with* to add information to nouns too.

![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adding%20information%20after%20nouns%2001.png)

|*Subject*|Verb|*Object/Description*|*Place/Time/Reason etc.*|
|---|---|---|---|
|**A friend from high school**|works||there.|
|**The bex under my bed**|is|full of old clothes.||
|We|have|**lessons for children**.||
|They|climbed||to **the hut on the mountain**.|
|I|sent|a gift|to **my cousin in Europe**.|
|We|went|camping|with **a family with two children**.|

We can also add *to* and a destination or goal (a noun or a verb) to a noun.
> **The road to the lake** is that way.
>
> This is **the place to be**.

We often add information to more than one noun in the sentence.
> I asked **the man in the shop** if they had **any books about gardening**.
> - The **man** is in the shop. I want **books** about gardening.

We can continue to add information to the same noun or another noun. We use our common sense to tell what the added information is referring to.
> **The boy near the window with black hair** is my nephew.
> - The **boy** is near the window. The **boy** has black hair. The **boy** is my nephew.
>
> **The boy near the window with blue curtains** is my nephew.
> - The **boy** is near the window. The **window** has blue curtains. The boy is my nephew.

Sometimes what the extra information is referring to is not clear.

|Subject|Verb|*Object*||
|---|---|---|---|
|||***main noun***|***Part***|
|I|saw|a man|with binoculars.|
> I saw **a man** ***with*** *binoculars*.
> - I saw a man. The man had binoculars.

|*Subject*|Verb|Object|*Part*|
|---|---|---|---|
|I|saw|a man|with binoculars.|
> **I** saw a man ***with*** *binoculars*.
> - I used binoculars and saw a man.

Sometimes the only way to be sure is to ask the speaker to make it clear.
> "Did you have the binoculars or did the man have the binoculars?"

In most situations common sense makes it obvious.
> Anna took a photo of a monkey **with** *my phone*.
> - Anna had my phone.
> - ![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adding%20information%20after%20nouns%2002.png)
>
> Anna took a photo of a monkey **with** *my phone*.
> - The monkey had my phone. This is less likely.
> - ![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adding%20information%20after%20nouns%2004.png)

> Anna took a photo of a monkey **with** *a long tail*.
> - **The monkey** had a long tail.
> - ![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adding%20information%20after%20nouns%2003.png)
>
> Anna took a photo of a monkey **with** *a long tail*.
> - No. This is ridiculous.
> - ![](./26.%20Describing%20nouns/adding%20information%20after%20nouns%2005.png)
