# Think and say 2
content clauses: reported speech

## ask
People *ask* questions. We say what people asked.

We use *if* when there are a limited number of possible answers.

We use *if* when we talk about yes/no questions. There are two possible answers, *yes* and *no*.

![](./22.%20Think%20and%20say%202/ask%2001.png)

We use *if* when we talk about questions with *or*. The options listed are the only possible answers.
> Would you like tea, coffee **or** juice?
>
> She asked ***if*** I'd like tea, coffee or juice.

|Subject|Verb||*Subject*|*Verb*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|||"Do|you|play|baseball?"|
|He|asked|**if**|I|played|baseball.|
|He|asked|**if**|I|play|baseball.|
|||"Can|we|go|to a restaurant or a bar?"|
|She|asked|**if**|we|could go|to a restaurant or a bar.|
|She|asked|**if**|we|can go|to a restaurant or a bar.|
|||"Will|Alice|win|an award?"|
|John|asked|**if**|Alice|would win|an award.|
|John|asked|**if**|Alice|will win|an award.|

### Practice
You are talking to some people in French. Your friend doesn't understand French. Tell him what he is being asked.

**Example**: 
> Pierre: (Do you play the piano?)
> - <u>Pierre asked if you played the piano</u>
> - or <u>Pierre asked if you play the piano</u>

1. Lola: (Are you from American?) ________.
2. Chloe: (Do you like France?) ________.
3. Hugo: (Are you hungry?) ________.
4. Pierre: (Can you teach me English?) ________.
5. Chloe: (Have you seen the Eiffel Tower?) ________.
6. Lola: (Are you coming shopping tomorrow?) ________.
7. Hugo: (Would you like to have some coffee?) ________.

We use **question words** when we ask for added information about a time, place, person, thing etc.

We use the question words *where, when, why* and *how*.
|Subject|Verb|*Question word*|*Subject*|*Verb*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|||"**Where** do|you|play|baseball?"|
|He|asked|**where**|I|played|baseball.|
|He|asked|**where**|I|play|baseball.|
|||"**Why** did|Alice|win|an award?"|
|John|asked|**why**|Alice|won|an award.|

We follow the same pattern when we ask about a subject or an object with *who* or *what*.
|Subject|Verb|*Question word*|*Subject*|*Verb*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|||"**What sports do|you|like?"||
|He|asked|**what** sports|I|liked.||
|He|asked|**what** sports|I|like.||
|||"**What** day is|it?|||
|She|asked|**what** day|it|was.||
|She|asked|**what** day|it|is.||
|||"**Who**||is|the tallest?"|
|They|asked|**who**||was|the tallest.*|
|They|asked|**who**||is|the tallest.*|
|They|asked|**who**|the tallest|was.*||
|They|asked|**who**|the tallest|is.*||

> \* We use *the tallest* as the subject or object. The meaning is the same. "Steve is the tallest" or "the tallest is Steve."

We often add a recipient. *(See page 202.)*
|Subject|Verb|*Recipient*|*Question word / if*|*Subject*|*Verb*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||||"**Where** did|you|go?"||
|He|asked|her|**where**|she|went.||
||||"**What day is|it?"|||
|She|asked|the teacher|**what** day|it|was.||
||||"Did|you|win|an award?"|
|John|asked|Alice|**if**|she|won|an award.|

### Practice
You are talking to some people in French. Your friend doesn't understand French. Tell hime what he is being asked. You can add a recipient (you), but it isn't needed in this situation.

**Example**:
> Pierre: (Where do you live?)
> - <u>Pierre asked (you) where you lived.</u>
> - or <u>Pierre asked (you) where you live.</u>

1. Lola: (What food do you like?) ________.
2. Chloe: (Where are you from?) ________.
3. Hugo: (What is your name?) ________
4. Pierre: (When did you arrive?) ________.
5. Chloe: (How was your flight?) ________.
6. Lola: (Who are you traveling with?) ________.
7. Hugo: (How long will you be in France?) ________.

## the meaning
When we tell people what was said the meaning is very important. We often choose to use more direct language rather than formal language so that the meaning is clear, even if the person spoke in more formal language.

|More direct:|More formal/polite:|
|---|---|
|![](./22.%20Think%20and%20say%202/the%20meaning%2001.png)|![](./22.%20Think%20and%20say%202/the%20meaning%2002.png)|
|"**Can** I come in?" (Is it an option?)|"**May** I come in?" (Is it one of my options?) *She wants to know if she has permisson. She wants to know if it is an option.*|
|She asked if she **could** come in.|She asked if she **could** come in.|

We don't need to use the same formal language when we tell people what someone said. We can use the same words or just express the meaning.
> "**Would** you like tea or coffee?"
> - He asked if I **wanted** tea or coffee. *(Expressing the meaning.)*
> - He asked if I **'d like** tea or coffee. *(Using the same words.)*

When someone uses informal language (sometimes rude) we often use more formal or polite language to communicate the meaning of what they said.

> "The air conditioner is **fucked**."
> - He said (that) the air conditioner was **broken**. *(Expressing the meaning without the swearing.)*

There are different ways of talking about the future. There are small differences but the basic meaning of any of these sentences fits the situation.

> April 16: "I **'ll take** a vacation in June."
> 
> April 23: She said (that) she **'d take** a vacation in June.
> 
> April 23: She said (that) she **was taking** a vacation in June.
> 
> April 23: She said (that) she **was going to take** a vacation in June.
> 
> April 23: She said (that) she **'d be taking** a vacation in June.
> 
> April 23: She said (that) she **'ll take** a vacation in June.
> 
> April 23: She said (that) she **'s taking** a vacation in June.
> 
> April 23: She said (that) she **'s going to take** a vacation in June.
> 
> April 23: She said (that) she **'ll be taking** a vacation in June.

We can use different words that express the same meaning.
> April 23: She said (that) she **was going on holiday** in June.

There are many more ways we can express this meaning. Common expressions in this situation include: *taking a vacation, taking a holiday, going on vacation* and *going on holiday*.

There are also different ways of talking about periods of time in the past.
> "I **would often play** tennis when I was a child."
>
> He said (that) he **would often play** tennis when he was a child.
>
> He said (that) he **used to play** tennis when he was a child.
>
> He said (that) he **often played** tennis when he was a child.

In some situations we use completely different verbs to make the meaning clear.

*Must* has no past form so we often use another expression that has a similar meaning such as *had to* or *needed to**.
> "You **must** come home early today."
>
> She told us we **had to** come home early that day.
>
> She told us we **needed to** come home early that day.

Using *must* is also possible. We know we are talking about the past because of the context.
> She told us we **must** come home early that day.

The meanings of *shall* and *should* often seem different, so we often use a expression (such as *want to*) that matches the meaning of what the person said.
> "**Shall** we go to a restaurant?"
>
> She asked me if I **wanted to** go to a restaurant.
> - She wanted to know what I thought was the right thing for us to do to make a decision.
>
> She asked me if we **should** go to a restaurant.
> - This has a different meaning. She wanted my advice. Was it hypothetically the right thing to do?

"Shall we go to a restaurant?" is a more polite way of saying "Do you want to go to a restaurant?"

    Speaking a second language isn't about substituting words from your first language into a new one, it is about understanding how to communicate in a new way. It is important to understand the meaning of what needs to be communicated and use words that express that meaning clearly.

### Practice
Make sentences explaning what the people said, told you or asked you.

**Example**: 
> "You must be home before 10:00."
> - She said <u> I had to be home before 10:00.</u>

1. "May I have a drink of water, please?" He said ________.
2. "Would you mind taking the dog outside?" She asked ________.
3. "I must buy her a present." He said ________.
4. "Can we go soon?" Sienna asked ________.
5. "Shall we go soon?" He asked ________.
6. "You must wear a tie." She said ________.
7. "I'm going to the park on Friday." You said ________.
8. "If it's not too much trouble, could I take the day off?" She said ________.

## telling people what to do
When we tell people what to do there is no subject.

![](./22.%20Think%20and%20say%202/telling%20people%20what%20to%20do%2001.png)

|Subject|Verb|*Recipient*|*to*|*Verb*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|||||Try|one.|
|She|asked|you|**to**|try|one.|

When we say what someone was told to do, we add *to* to show things happening in sequence. *(See page 82.)*
1. say/ask/tell
2. do (verb)

|Subject|Verb|*Recipient*|Polite language|*to*|*Verb*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||||"Please||go."||
|He|said|||**to**|go.||
||||"Could you please||be|quiet?"|
|She|asked|the children||**to**|be|quiet.|
||||||"Win|an award."|
|John|told|Alice||**to**|win|an award.|

We usually use polite language like "please" and "could you" when we ask people to do things. When we say what people told us to do we use direct language so the meaning is clear.

When we make negative sentences we add not.
|Subject|Verb|*Recipient*|Polite language|*not*|*to*|*Verb*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||||"Please|do**n't**||go."||
|He|said|||**not**|**to**|go.||
|||||"Do**n't**||make|a sound."|
|She|told|the children||**not**|**to**|make|a sound.|
||||"Could you|**not**||make|a speech?"|
|John|asked|Alice||**not**|**to**|make|a speech.|

### Practice
Make sentences explaning what the people said, told you or asked you.

**Example**: 
> "Please try one."
> - She asked me <u>to try one</u>.

1. "Please open your textbooks to page 128." The teacher told us ________.
2. "Could you call Hannah?" Sienna said ________.
3. "Don't be late." He said ________.
4. "Please don't leave the door open." Leo told me ________.
5. "Could you please carry my bags?" She asked me ________.

## about
We use *about* to show something is near a point.
> It's **about** 10:00.
> - Not exactly, but near that point in time. It's really 9:58.
>
> ![](./22.%20Think%20and%20say%202/about%2001.png)

We also use *about* when we are not referring to the exact point someone makes when they speak. We often simplify what people say and tell people the general topic.
> She talked **about** her family.
> - She said a few main points.
>
> ![](./22.%20Think%20and%20say%202/about%2002.png)

|Subject|Verb|*Recipient*|*about*|*Topic*|Place/Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|She|talled||about|her family.||
|He|spoke||about|his experience|in the jungle.|
|We|asked|the boss|about|holiday pay.||
|They|told|us|about|the old days.||
|I|think||about|her|all the time.|

### Practice
Complete the sentences. Use *about* for general topics. Leave the space blank when we are giving specific information.

**Exmaple**: 
*(Topic: her family)* She talked <u>about her family</u>.
1. Tell me ____ your new job.
2. Could you tell me ____ the time? 
3. We asked ____ how hot it was.
4. We asked ____ the weather.
5. She gave a presentation ____ the environment.
6. He always thinks ____ other people.
7. Hey, stop! What are you doing here? Who are you? Tell me ____ your name.

## hopes and wishes
We use the *present form* for thins that are **real**. We use the *past form* for things that are **hypothetical**.

|||
|---|---|
|We **hope** for things we want in the present-future. These things are possible.|We **wish** for things we are imagining. We talk about them hypothetically.|
|I **hope** it **is** sunny.|I **wish** it **was** sunny.|
|![](./22.%20Think%20and%20say%202/hopes%20and%20wishes%2001.png)|![](./22.%20Think%20and%20say%202/hopes%20and%20wishes%2002.png)|
|It is possible that it's sunny. I don't know, I haven't looked outside. *There's a real chance.*|It isn't sunny. *Was* is in the past tense because we are not talking about the real present-future. *We are talking hypothetically. (See page 111.)*

Hopes and wished often need a subject and verb to explain the details.
|*Subject*|*Verb*|*(that)*|Subject|*Verb*|Object/Description|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**He**|**hopes**|(that)|she|looks|amazing.|*He doesn't know how she looks yet.*|
|**She**|**hopes**|(that)|she|is|home before 7:30.|*She'll try, but may be late.*|
|**I**|**wish**|(that)|he|was|happy.|*He isn't happy.*|
|**I**|**wish**|(that)|we|had|a full tank of gas.|*We don't have a full tank of gas.*|

### Practice

1. I ____ I could fly.
2. I ____ they compromise.

4. She ____ to be a singer.
5. They ____ they can afford it.
