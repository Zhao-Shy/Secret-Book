# Think and say 1
content clauses: reported thoughts and reported speech

## say
When we say what someone said we can use *say* and their **exact words*.
> Todd says, "I live in San Francisco."

We use *said* for the past.
> Todd said, "I live in San Francisco."

This style is often used in novels. We read exactly what each character said.

There is often no reason to use the exact words (we often don't remember them anyway!).

The **meaning** is more important. We make a sentence with the same meaning.

|---|---|
|Todd talks **about the present**.|Todd talks **about the past**.|
|1. "I **live** in San Francisco."|1. "I **lived** in San Francisco."|
|2. Todd **says** (that) he **lives** in San Francisco.|2. Todd **says** (that) he **lived** in San Francisco.|

> Todd would have used the word */*, but we use *he* to make it clear we are referring to Todd.

> - *That* is optional in these sentences. *That* is used to refer to a separate point.
> - *That* is not needed, but using *that* prepares the listener for the point that follows.

|---|---|
|We say what Todd **said in the past**. This was true at the time he spoke (in the past) so we use the *past form* of *live (lived)*.|We can use the *present form* if we think it is still true in the present.|
|1. "I **live** in San Francisco."|1. "I **lived** in San Francisco."|
|2. Todd **says** (that) he **lives** in San Francisco.|2. Todd **says** (that) he **lived** in San Francisco.|

We often talk about what people **said in the past** and refer to the time in the past it was said.

When there is more than one verb the first verb is in the *past form*.
|Subject|Verb|(that)|*Subject*|*Verb*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||||"**I**|**'ve finished**|work."|
|She|said|(that)|**she**|**'d finished**|work.
||||"**I**|**'m watching**|a movie."|
|He|said|(that)|**he**|**was watching**|a movie.|

It often doesn't matter which way we say it as long as we communicate the meaning.

In the following situation we can use *says* or *said*. There are different ways of thinking about it.

|***Says*** - The speaker's words are being passed on to the listener in the **present**.|***Said*** - Then person speaks, then you say what they said. They spoke in the **past**.|
> The above examples use *is* in the present form. When we are translating, the information is true in the present.

### Practice
Tell your American friend what your Japanese friend says. Use she.

**Example**:

2. (I live in Tokyo.) ________
3. (I'm studying science.) ________
4. (I have been to America before.) ________
5. (I went to North Carolina last year.) ________

### Practice
Tell your coworker what people said at the meeting last month. Things have changed since then.

**Example**: 
> Brenda: The light in room six needs to be changed.
> - <u>Brenda said the light in room six needed to be changed.</u>

1. Stephanie: Sales are down. ________
2. Raymond: We need to get more customers. ________
3. Justin: Some customers are having trouble ordering. ________
4. Stephanie: Delivery has been taking too long. ________
5. Raymond: Customers have asked for cheaper products. ________
6. Brenda: We have to hire new staff. ________
7. Justin: I have a headache. ________

We can also look at it from another perspective and say what we hear or heard.

We don't need to say who said it.

> I **heard** (that) Todd lives in San Francisco.
