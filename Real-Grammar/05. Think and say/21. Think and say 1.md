# Think and say 1
content clauses: reported thoughts and reported speech

## say
When we say what someone said we can use *say* and their **exact words*.
> Todd says, "I live in San Francisco."

We use *said* for the past.
> Todd said, "I live in San Francisco."

This style is often used in novels. We read exactly what each character said.

There is often no reason to use the exact words (we often don't remember them anyway!).

The **meaning** is more important. We make a sentence with the same meaning.

|||
|---|---|
|Todd talks **about the present**.|Todd talks **about the past**.|
|1. "I **live** in San Francisco."|1. "I **lived** in San Francisco."|
|2. Todd **says** (that) he **lives** in San Francisco.|2. Todd **says** (that) he **lived** in San Francisco.|
|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/say%2001.png)|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/say%2002.png)|
> Todd would have used the word */*, but we use *he* to make it clear we are referring to Todd.

> ![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/say%2003.png) 
> - *That* is optional in these sentences. *That* is used to refer to a separate point.
> - *That* is not needed, but using *that* prepares the listener for the point that follows.

|||
|---|---|
|We say what Todd **said in the past**. This was true at the time he spoke (in the past) so we use the *past form* of *live (lived)*.|We can use the *present form* if we think it is still true in the present.|
|1. "I **live** in San Francisco."|1. "I **lived** in San Francisco."|
|2. Todd **says** (that) he **lives** in San Francisco.|2. Todd **says** (that) he **lived** in San Francisco.|
|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/say%2004.png)|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/say%2005.png)|

We often talk about what people **said in the past** and refer to the time in the past it was said.

When there is more than one verb the first verb is in the *past form*.
|Subject|Verb|(that)|*Subject*|*Verb*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||||"**I**|**'ve finished**|work."|
|She|said|(that)|**she**|**'d finished**|work.
||||"**I**|**'m watching**|a movie."|
|He|said|(that)|**he**|**was watching**|a movie.|

It often doesn't matter which way we say it as long as we communicate the meaning.

In the following situation we can use *says* or *said*. There are different ways of thinking about it.
|||
|---|---|
|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/say%2006.png)|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/say%2007.png)|
|***Says*** - The speaker's words are being passed on to the listener in the **present**.|***Said*** - Then person speaks, then you say what they said. They spoke in the **past**.|
> The above examples use *is* in the present form. When we are translating, the information is true in the present.

### Practice
Tell your American friend what your Japanese friend says. Use she.

**Example**: 
> *(I play the piano.)* 
> - She says (that) she plays the piano *or* she said (that) she plays the piano.

1. (My name is Yuki.) ________
2. (I live in Tokyo.) ________
3. (I'm studying science.) ________
4. (I have been to America before.) ________
5. (I went to North Carolina last year.) ________
6. (My brother lives in Greensboro.) ________

### Practice
Tell your coworker what people said at the meeting last month. Things have changed since then.

**Example**: 
> Brenda: The light in room six needs to be changed.
> - <u>Brenda said the light in room six needed to be changed.</u>

1. Stephanie: Sales are down. ________
2. Raymond: We need to get more customers. ________
3. Justin: Some customers are having trouble ordering. ________
4. Stephanie: Delivery has been taking too long. ________
5. Raymond: Customers have asked for cheaper products. ________
6. Brenda: We have to hire new staff. ________
7. Justin: I have a headache. ________

We can also look at it from another perspective and say what we hear or heard.

We don't need to say who said it.

> I **heard** (that) Todd lives in San Francisco.

---

## said about the past
We talk about people speaking in the past about something that happened  **before they spoke**.

We can use the past form for both main verbs. We assume it happened **before** the person spoke.

    This sentence pattern is common, but some people don't consider it grammatically correct.

> 1. "I **went** shopping on Sunday."
> 2. He **said** (that) he **went** shopping *on Sunday*.

![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20the%20past%2001.png)

Or, we can use *had + -en form* to clearly say it happened before the person spoke.
> 1. "I **went** shopping on Sunday."
> 2. He **said** (that) he **had been** shopping *on Sunday*.

![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20the%20past%2002.png)

|Subject|Verb|(that)|*Subject*|*Verb*|Object etc.|*Time*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||||"I|**played**|baseball|on Saturday morning."|
|He|said|(that)|he|**played**|baseball|on Saturday morning.|
|He|said|(that)|he|**'d played**|baseball|on Saturday morning.|
||||"we|**went**|to a restaurant|on Friday night."|
|She|said|(that)|they|**went**|to a restaurant|on Friday night.|
|She|said|(that)|they|**'d been**|to a restaurant|on Friday night.|

### Practice
Tell your friend what Kate and Daniel told you yesterday. There are two ways you can answer, use whatever makes more sense for you.

I saw Kate and Daniel yesterday...

1. Kate: We went away on vacation in December. ________
2. Daniel: We went away for two weeks. ________
3. Daniel: We had a great time. ________
4. Kate: I got a new job last week. ________
5. Kate: I got a haircut on Tuesday. ________
6. Daniel: I ate a big sandwich for lunch on Sunday. ________
7. Kate: We saw a good movie on Wednesday night. ________

---

## said about the future
We talk about people speaking in the past about something that happened **after they spoke**.

People speak about what is happening in the future using *am/is/are + -ing form* (1). When we say what they said we use *was/were* to make it clear we are referring to **after they spoke**, not after now (2). 
> 1. "I **'m going** shopping on Thursday."
> 2. "He **said** (that) he *was going* shopping *on Thursday*.

![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20the%20future%2001.png)

People speak about **scheduled events** in the future using the *present form* (1). However, when we say what someone said, we use *was/were + -ing form* to clearly say it happened **after they spoke** (2).

> 1. "We **arrive** on Thursday."
> 2. She **said** (that) they **were arriving** *on Thursday*.

![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20the%20future%2002.png)

> *When we say 'I spoke with her on Tuesday and she said they **were arriving** on Thursday' (as in the example above), we know she arrived the Thursday after I spoke with her. However, if we say 'I spoke with her on Tuesday and she said they **arrived** on Thursday', it sounds like they had already arrived the Thursday **before** I spoke with her.*

If it hasn't happened yet, we often use the *present form* (it happens in the future, **after now**).
> 1. "We **arrive** on Monday."
> 2. She **said** (that) they **arrive** *on Monday*.

![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20the%20future%2003.png)

> *For the top example, we can also say 'He said he **'s going** shopping on Thursday' if he is going shopping in the future.*

### Practice
Tell your friend what Kate and Daniel told you yesterday. There may be more than one answer.
1. Kate: We're going away on vacation in July. ________
2. Daniel: We leave on the 6th. ________
3. Kate: I'm starting my new job today. ________
4. Daniel: I'm going to eat a big sandwich for lunch. ________

## said about options and possbilities
When we say what someone said in the past, we use *could, might* or *would* to talk about what was an option or possibility at the time.

> 1. "I**'ll** go shopping on Thursday."
> 2. He **said** he **would** go shopping *on Thursday*.

![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20options%20and%20possibilities%2001.png)

If it is still an option or possbility we can use the *present form*.
> 1. "I **'ll** go shopping on Monday."
> 2. He **said** he *'ll* go shopping *on Monday*.

![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20options%20and%20possibilities%2002.png)

Or, we can use the *past form*. It was also an option or possibility in the past when it was said.
> 1. "I **'ll** go shopping on Monday."
> 2. He **said** he **would** go shopping *on Monday*.

![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20options%20and%20possibilities%2003.png)

We use the past forms of *can (could), may (might)* and *will (would)*.

||Subject|Verb|(that)|*Subject*|*Verb*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Monday: ||||"We|**can** play|baseball."|
|Tuesday: |He|said|(that)|they|**could** play|baseball.|
|Monday: ||||"Alice|**may** win|an award."|
|Tuesday: |John|said|(that)|Alice|**might** win|an award.|
|Monday: ||||"I|**'ll'** have|a coffee."|
|Tuesday: |She|said|(that)|she|**'d'** have|a coffee.|

The past form is used for things that are not in the present-future. When we use *could, would, should* or *might*, we know if it is in the **past** or **hypothetical** because of the context.

|||
|---|---|
|2. George *said* he *would* pick me and he did.|2. Michael *said* he *would* pick me up if he had more time.|
|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20options%20and%20possibilities%2005.png)|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20options%20and%20possibilities%2004.png)|
|1. "I'll pick you up." (a promise in the past)|1. "I'd pick you up if I had more time." (hypothetical)|

We add *have + -en form* to say something happened before a time in the past, or before the hypothetical present (hypothetical in the past).

|||
|---|---|
|2. She *said* George *would have picked* Sarah up.|2. Michael *said* he *would have picked* me up if he had more time.|
|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20options%20and%20possibilities%2007.png)|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/said%20about%20options%20and%20possibilities%2006.png)|
|1. "George will have picked Sarah up." *A prediction about before a time in the past.*|1. "I'd pick you up if I had more time". *This was hypothetical in the past, said before pick up. Pick up was in the past so it's not a hypothetical option anymore. or* "I would have picked you up if I had more time." *This was said after pick up, hypothetical before a time in the past.*|

### Practice

|6. "I might go if I have the money."|->|He didn't go. He said ________ if he had the money.|
|7. "I'd like a sandwich."|->|She said ________.|

## time and place
We often talk about what someone said (in the past) about another time in the past. We clearly state the time so the listener knows when these things happened.

We use other workds to say something happens in relation to another time.

![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/time%20and%20place%2001.png)

We use words like *yesterday, today* and *tomorrow* in relation to **now**.

![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/time%20and%20place%2002.png)

We use other words in relation to other times. These times may be in the **past** or **future**.

![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/time%20and%20place%2003.png)

|from now|from another time||from now|from another time||from now |from another time|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|last week|*the week before*||last month|*the monthe before*||last year|*the year before*|
|this week|*that week*||this month|*that month*||this year|*that year*|
|next week|*the next week*||next month|*the next monthe*||next year|*the next year*|

*Next week* and *the next week* sound similar, but refer to different times.

We can say *the following week* to be clear.

We can also say *the following day, the following month* and *the following year*.

||Subject|Verb|(that)|*Subject*|*Verb*|Object etc.|*Time*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|May:||||"I|played|baseball|yesterday."|
|August:|He|said|(that)|he|played|baseball|the day before.|
|May:||||"We|'re going|to a restaurant|next week."|
|August:|She|said|(that)|they|were going|to a restaurant|the next week.|
||She|said|(that)|they|were going|to a restaurant|the following week.|
|May:||||"Alice|won|an award|last month."|
|August:|John|said|(that)|Alice|won|an award|the month before.|
|2012:||||"I|'m going|to Europe|this year."|
|This year:|You|said|(that)|you|were going|to Europe|that year.|
> I saw Sam last week. He was exhausted. 
> - He said that he'd played baseball the day before.
>
> I talked to Paige two months ago. 
> - She said they were going to a restaurant the next week.
>
> I talked to John in spring.
> - He said that Alice *had* won an award the month before.
>
> I haven't seen you since 2012, you said you were going to Europe that year. How was it?

We use *here* and *there* in a similar way to say when talking about places. *Here* and *there* are in relation to the person speaking.

|||
|---|---|
|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/time%20and%20place%2004.png)|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/time%20and%20place%2005.png)|
|*here*: where the person speaking is.|*there*: not where the person speaking is. *(we know or say where it is)*|

## think and know
We use other verbs such as *think* in the same way.
|||
|---|---|
|We talk about what we think about now.|We talk about what we think about the past.|
|I **think** he **buys** food.|I **think** he **bought** food.|
|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/think%20and%20know%2001.png)|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/think%20and%20know%2002.png)|

|||
|---|---|

|I **thought** he **bought** food.|I **thought** he **would buy** food.|
|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/think%20and%20know%2003.png)|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/think%20and%20know%2004.png)|

|||
|---|---|
|We can also use *had + -en form* to say what we thought about the past of the past.|We use *would have + -en form* to talk about a result we predicted in the past. We are often surprised because what we predicted isn't what happened.|
|I **thought** he **had bought** food.|I **thought** he **would have bought** food.|
|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/think%20and%20know%2005.png)|![](./21.%20Think%20and%20say%201/think%20and%20know%2006.png)|
|*Past thought: he has bought food. There was evidence to suggest this happened.*|*Past thought: he will have bought food. I expected the result: we have food, but he didn't buy it.*|

What we **know** is the **truth**. What we **think** is our **opinion**.
> I **knew** it **would** work.
> - The truth: it worked.
>
> I **thought** it **would** work.
> - My opinion: it may or may not have worked.
