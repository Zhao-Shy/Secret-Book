*May* is considered slightly more likely; it refers to real possibility.

*Might* is considered slightly less likely; it refers to a possibility we are imagining.

However, it is personal preference, and you will find people using both in similar situations.

I use *might* more when speaking; I go straight from what I imagine in my mind to my mouth.

I use *may* more when writing; I take my time, and think more about what may really happen.
