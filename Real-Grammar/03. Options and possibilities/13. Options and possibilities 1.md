## the past form isn't just for the past
when we think about options and possibilities we think about them being either **real** or **hypothetical**.

When we talk about **real** options and possibilities we use the *present form*. *(can, will, shall, may and must)*

> ![](./static-resource/13.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%201/the%20past%20form%20isn't%20just%20for%20the%20past%2001.png)
>
> I think I **am** lucky.
> - Reality: I am lucky.
>
> I **'ll** have a beer. *(I'll = I will)*
> - Reality: beer.

The *past form* refers to things that are NOT in th PRESENT or FUTURE. It is mainly used for the past, but is also used for **hypothetical** situations. These are things we are **imagining**.

> ![](./static-resource/13.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%201/the%20past%20form%20isn't%20just%20for%20the%20past%2002.png)
>
> I wish I **was** lucky.
> - Imagining: I am lucky.
> - Reality: I am not lucky.

When we talk about **hypothetical** options and possibilities we use the *past form*. *(could, would, should and might)*

> ![](./static-resource/13.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%201/the%20past%20form%20isn't%20just%20for%20the%20past%2003.png)
>
> I **would** have a beer, but I'm driving today.
> - Imagining: having a beer.
> - Reality: no beer, I'm driving.

## real or hypothetical
There are situations when we use either *can* or *could*. We can think in a real or hypothetical way. Saying something in a hypothetical way is less direct and more polite.

|||
|---|---|
|We use *can* to ask if something is an option in the present-future.|We use *could* to ask if something is hypothetically an option.|
|**Can** I open the window?|**Could** I open the window?|
|![](./static-resource/13.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%201/real%20or%20hypothetical%2001.png)|![](./static-resource/13.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%201/real%20or%20hypothetical%2002.png)

|*can*|Subject|*Verb*|Object|≈|*could*|Subject|*Verb*|Object|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||I|borrow|your phone?|< more direct = more polite >|**Could**|I|borrow|your phone?|
|**Can**|you|trun off|the TV?|< more direct = more polite >|**Could**|you|trun off|the TV?|
||I|have|some salad?|< more direct = more polite >|**Could**|I|have|some salad?|

The meaning is basically the same. *Can* is more direct, it is talking about something real. It is more polite to express what we want less directly - as something we are imagining. *Could* is used in more formal situations.

*Can* is more common in some situations.
> '*Can* I help you?'
> - What I am offering **is an option** in the present-future.

We often use the *past form* to be less direct.
> **Do** you want a drink? ≈ **Did** you want a drink?
> 
> **Do** you need some help? ≈ **Did** you need some help?
> 
> What **is** your name? ≈ What **was** your name?

### Practice
Complete the sentences with *can* or *could*. There may be more than one answer.

1. A: Hi ____ I help you?
2. B: Yes, ____ I have a coffee please.
3. ____ you please make it extra strong?
4. A: Ok. ____ I get you anything else?
5. B: Yes, ____ I have some cake, please.
6. A: Ok.

## could have done
We use *could* to imagine different options or possibilities. We can imagine how things could be different as a result of something being different in the past.

> A: My legs are so sore.
>
> B: I don't know why you walked. You **could have taken** the bus.
>
> ![](./static-resource/13.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%201/could%20have%20done%2001.png)
> - A different past (taking the bus instead of walking) means a different present (no sore legs). Taking the bus was an option.

||Subject|*could*|*have -en*|Description|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||The package|**could**|have arrived||by now.|
|**Could**|it||have rained?|||
||It|**couldn't**|have been|easier.||

> The package could have arrived by now.
> - It could be waiting in my office. It is possible.
>
> Could it have rained?
> - It looks a little wet, but there are no clouds in the sky? Is it possible?
>
> It couldn't have been easier.
> - It was very easy. Being easier was not possible.

> *We also say **could've** instead of **could have***.

### Practice

> A: How was your job interview?
> 
> **Ex.** B: Ok, but it <u>could have been</u> (be) better.
