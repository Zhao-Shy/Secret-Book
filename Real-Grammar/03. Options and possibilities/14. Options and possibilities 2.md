# Options and possibilities 2
modal verbs

## will
We use *will* when we think about options and possibilities. We say the chosen option (a decision) or the possibility that we believe is really happening (a prediction)

We use *will* when there are options or possibilities in the future. *(I'll = I will)*

|I **'ll** open the window.|It **'ll** be sunny today.|

|---|---|---|---|---|
|She|**'ll**|wait.|||
|I|**'ll**|watch|TV|all day.|
|He|**won't**|drink|coffee|today.|

We use *will* when we think about options and make a **decision** and when we think about possibilities and make a **prediction**. *(Won't = will not.)*

|Decisions|Predictions|
|---|---|
|I **'ll** have a coffee.|It **'ll** rain tomorrow.|
|We **'ll** buy a new bed.|We **'ll** have flying cars in 2050.|
|**Will** we go out for lunch today?|**Will** it be sunny tomorrow?|

We also use *will* when there are options or possibilities in the present.

> Madison said she's coming to visit us. She wants to...
> *(knock knock)*
> Ah, that'll be her now.
> - I don't know who is at the door, it may be Madison or someone else. I think it is Madison.

    IMPORTANT: 'Will' is only used when we are thinking about options and possibilities. There are often options and possibilities in the future, so we often use 'will' when we talk about the future. However, there are many ways of talking about the future. (See page 152.)

## would
We use *would* (the past form *will*) to talk about options and possibilities we are **imagining**.

> I **would** open the window, but my legs are too sore from all that walking.
>
> ![](./14.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%202/would%2001.png)
>
> - I won't actually open the window.

|Subject|*would*|Verb|Object|but...|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|**would**|buy|a hat|but I don't have enough money. So I won't.|
|She|**would**|turn off|her phone|but the button is broken. So she won't.|
|He|**would**|go|skiing|but he has hurt his back. So he won't.|

We use *wouldn't* when we talk about an option or possibility in the past that didn't happen. We often wanted it to happen. *(wouldn't = would not)*

> I tried many times but the car **wouldn't** start.
> - I conclude that it wasn't possible.
>
> I asked him nicely but he **wouldn't** give me any pizza.
> - He had options. He decided not to.

When we think about the past, we consider options we had at the time. We use *would* to say what often happened. *(See page 161.)*

|*TIme*|Subject|*would*|*Verb*|Object/Place|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|When we lived in China|we|**would**|use|chopsticks|every day.|
|When he didn't read at school|he|**would**|often read|at home.|
|When she was a student|she|**would**|work||in the evening.|

> We don't need to use would. Saying 'When we lived in China we used chopsticks every day.' is fine. There are different ways of thinking about it.

## would like
We use *would* (with *like*) to offer and ask for things in a polite way. We are not directly telling someone to do something, we are expressing what we are imagining.

![](./14.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%202/would%20like%2001.png)

When we politely ask people if they want things, we aks with *would*.
> Do you want a drink?
> - very direct
>
> **Would** you like a drink?
> - (much more polite) Imagine having a drink, do you like that thought?

When we say we want something there are different ways we can ask. All of the sentences below are very common and fit this situation. Speaking hypothetically is more polite.

||*present form (real)*|past form (hypothetical)|
|---|---|---|
|***can/could (is it an option?)***|**Can** I have a coffee?|**Could** I have a coffee?|
|***will/would (what we decide)***|I **'ll** have a coffee.|I **'d** like a coffee.|

> To politely say we don't want something, we say 'No, thank you' or 'I'm fine, thank you'.

### Practice
Complete the conversation with *will* or *would*. Use the short forms (*'ll* and *'d*) when possible.

> Waiter: Hi, are you ready to order?

    Customer B: No, thank you.
    Waiter: Ok, so a bottle of house red, the steak and the chicken curry. Your meals ____ be ready soon.
    Customer A: Thank you.

>

## shall / should
We use *shall* to say something is the RIGHT thing to do. We often use it in questions when we make suggestions.

> **Shall** we go soon?
>
> ![](./14.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%202/shall%20should%2001.png)
> - We are asking if going soon is the right thing to do. We want someone else's opinion.

We say what is the right option, hypothetically speaking.

|---|---|---|---|
|I|**should**|buy|a hat.|

We sometimes use *should* when we know the right thing to do, but do something else.

> - Going to the gym is the right thing to do. I won't do it though.
>

> 
> B: I **shouldn't**, I'm on a diet. But, it is a special occasion... ok.

We also use *should* when we consider possibilities.
> The bus **should** arrive soon.
> - This is the possibility expect - assuming everything goes right.

---

We can imagine how things could be different as a result of doing the right thing in the past.

> A: My legs are so sore.
> B: I don't know why you walked. You **should haven taken** the bus.
>
> ![](./14.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%202/should%20have%20done%2001.png)

## ought
*Ought* is a very unusual verb; it has **no** *present form*. We use *ought (past form)* when we think **hypothetically** and say what is **expected**. Verbs ending in -ought/-aught are common past forms *(thought, bought, brought, taught etc.)*

|Subject|*Verb 1*||*Verb 2*|Object|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||***Verb***|***to***||||
|I|**ought**|**to**|buy|a hat.|*I need a hat so I will do it, as expected.*|
|You|**ought**|**to**|turn off|your phone.|*Appropriate behavior: what is expected.*|
|He|**ought**|**to**|be|quiet.|*Appropriate behavior: what is expected.*|
|It|**ought**|**to**|be|good.|*Saying how I expect it to be.*|

There are many situations where *ought* or *should* can be used. *Ought* is less direct (talking about a **general expectaion**), so it is used in more formal situations. We use *should* when we think about options or possibilities and give an **opinion** about **what is right**. There are different ways of thinking and both are acceptable, but *should* is far more common.

> You **ought** to get a haircut. 
> - You are **expected** to do this.
>
> You **should** get a haircut.
> - You have options. I think this is **the right thing** for you to do.
>
> We **ought** to be home soon.
> - This is what is **expected** given the situation.
>
> We **should** be home soon.
> - This is a possibility. What I expect if everthing goes **right**.

![](./14.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%202/ought%2001.png)

*Ought (to)* is actually more common than *should* when followed by *punch you*! We often use *ought* in this way when we talk about something that we don't think is right that is said in frustration.

*Ought (to)* is also more common than usual when followed by *slap you, kick you* and *beat you*. These things are clearly not right, but we may hypothetically expect them to happen to someone if they behave inappropriately.

> I **ought** to punch you. 
> - This is hypothetical. I'm not really going to punch you, but I'm saying people generally expect someone to do this in this situation. I don't do it because I don't think it is right.
