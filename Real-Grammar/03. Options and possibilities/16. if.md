# if
conditional sentences

## if
We use *if* to talk about consequences of options and possibilities we have at a time in the present-future.

|||
|---|---|
|**If** we *leave now*, we'll be home in time for the game.|**If** the traffic *is* bad, we *won't* be home in time.|
|![](./16.%20if/if%2001.png)|![](./16.%20if/if%2002.png)|
|*Option: leave. Consequences: we'll be home in time for the game.*|*Possibility: bad traffic. Consequences: we won't be home in time.*|

We can speak **hypothetically** about something that is less likely or impossible.

We use the *past form* for hypothetical situations. *(leave - **left**, will - **would**)*

|||
|---|---|
|If we *left now*, we would be home in time for the game.|If I *were* you, I *would* watch the game here.|
|![](./16.%20if/if%2003.png)|![](./16.%20if/if%2003.png)|
|*Hypothetical option: leave. Hypothetical consequence: we would be home in time for the game.*|***Not possible**, but hypothetically: I am you. Hypothetical consequence: I would watch the game here. ('if I 'was' you' is also fine - See page 143)*|

We can put either part first.

|*if*|Subject|*Verb*|Ob./Desc.|Time|S.|*will*|Verb|Ob./Place|Place/Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**If**|we|**leave**||now,|we|**will**|be|home|in time for the game.|
|**If**|the traffic|**is**|bad,||we|**won't**|be|home|in time.|
|**If**|I|**were**|you,||I|**would**|watch|the game|here.|

|S.|*will*|Verb|Ob./Place|Place/Time|*if*|Subject|*Verb*|Ob./Desc.|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|**will**|be|home|in time for the game|**if**|we|**leave**||now.|
|We|**won't**|be|home|in time|**if**|the traffic|**is**|bad.||
|I|**would**|watch|the game|here|**if**|I|**were**|you.||

We also use *can/could, may/might, shall/should* and *must/had better* in *if* sentences. We use these the same way we use *will/would*.
> **If** we *leave now*, we **can** watch the game at home.
>
> **If** we *leave now*, we **could** watch the game at home.
>
> **If** we *leave now*, we **may** be home in time for the game.
>
> **If** we *leave now*, we **might** be home in time for the game.
>
> **Shall** we leave now **if** we *want* to watch the game at home?
>
> **If** we *want* to watch the game at home, we **should** leave now.
>
> **If** we *want* to watch the game at home, we **must** leave now.
>
> **If** we *want* to watch the game at home, we **had better** leave now.

We use *if* to talk about something that happens because something else happens, a **consequence**.

These things generally happen, many times, so the verbs are in the present form.
> If it *rains*, I *get* wet.
>
> ![](./16.%20if/if%2004.png)
> - Possibility: rain
> - Consequence: I get wet.

## would have... if...
We can talk about how things could have been different if we made a different decision in the past.
> My legs *wouldn't have been* sore **if** I *had take* the bus.
>
> ![](./16.%20if/would%20have...%20if...%2001.png)
> - What **really** happened: 
>   - I walked.
>   - My legs were sore because I *had walked*.
>   - My legs *have been* sore.

|Subject|*would*|*have -en*|Obejct etc.|*if*|Subject|*had -en*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|The package|would|have arrived||if|the address|had been|correct.|
|I|wouldn't|have eaten|that last pie|if|someone|had wanted|it.|
|It|would|have been|easy|if|I|had had|my tools.|

> The package would have arrived if the address had been correct.
> - The address wasn't correct so it don't arrive.
>
> I wouldn't have eaten that last pie if someone had wanted it.
> - No one wanted the last pie so I ate it.
>
> It would have been easy if I had had my tools.
> - I didn't have my tools, so it wasn't easy.

We often simplify and use the *past form* in the *if* part.

We use the *past form* when something happened at a time in the past. The listener knows we are talking about another option or possibility before something happened.

    This structure is common, especially in spoken English, but people may find it ungrammatical.
    In formal writing or exams the more traditional structure above with 'had' is recommended.

> My legs *wouldn't have been* sore **if** I *took* the bus.
> 
> ![](./16.%20if/would%20have...%20if...%2002.png)
> - What **really** happened:
>   - I *walked*
>   - My legs *have been* sore.

|Subject|*would*|*have -en*|Obejct etc.|*if*|Subject|*Verb(past)*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|The package|would|have arrived||if|the address|was|correct.|
|I|wouldn't|have eaten|that last pie|if|someone|wanted|it.|
|It|would|have been|easy|if|I|had|my tools.|

> The package would have arrived if the address was correct.
> - The address wasn't correct when it was written, so it didn't arrive.
>
> I wouldn't have eaten that last pie if someone wanted it.
> - No one wanted the last pie at the time, so I ate it.
>
> It would have been easy if I had my tools.
> - I didn't have my tools at the time, so it wasn't easy.

We can use *could* instead of *would* to say something may have been possible.

We use *may* or *might* if we are less certain.

We use *had + -en form* after *if*...
> We *would have been* home in time for the game if we *'d left* at 4.
>
> We *could have been* home in time for the game we *'d left* at 4.
>
> We *may have been* home in time for the game if we *'d left* at 4.
>
> We *might have been* home in time for the game if we *'d left* at 4.

or the *past form* after *if*...
> We *would have been* home in time for the game if we *left* at 4.
>
> We *could have been* home in time for the game if we *left* at 4.
>
> We *may have been* home in time for the game if we *left* at 4.
>
> We *might have been* home in time for the game if we *left* at 4.

***If I were*** and ***If I was***
Some people tend to use *were* when they are talking about something they are imagining. This helps separate the past and hypothetical. It is traditionally considered grammatically correct.
> If **I were** you, I would have traveled abroad.
> - We know this is hypothetical because *were* is used.
>
> She'd ask for food if **she were** hungry.
> - We know this is hypothetical because *were* is used.

There is no reason not to say *I was* or *she was* the same as when we talk about the past. We know it is hypothetical because of the context. These sentences are also very common.
> If **I was** you, I would have traveled abroad.
> - We know this is hypothetical because of the context.
>
> She'd ask for food if **she was** hungry.
> - We know this is hypothetical because of the context.

### Practice
Complete the sentences to talk about how the past may have been different.

1. We ____ (go) shopping if it ____ (rain) yesterday.
2. If it ____ (not rain) we ____ (go) fishing.
3. Sorry I didn't call you. I had to work overtime. If I ____ (finish) on time, I ____ (call) you.
4. conversation
   - A: Did you go out last night?
   - B: No, but I ____ (go) out if I ____ (not be) feeling sick.
5. conversation
   - A: You went out last night? Were you still feeling sick?
   - B: I felt great! I ____ (not go) out if I ____ (be) feeling sick.

## if: polite expressions
We use expressions with *if* to be less direct and more polite.

|Asking for permission|Asking people to do things|
|---|---|
|**If you don't mind**, could I borrow some money?|**If you don't mind**, could you meet me tomorrow morning?|
|**If it is ok**(with you), could I borrow some money?|**If it is ok**(with you), could you meet me tomorrow morning?|
|**Do you mind if** I borrow some money?|**If you have time**, could you meet me tomorrow morning?|
|**Is it ok**(with you) **if** I borrow some money?|Could you meet me tomorrow morning **if you're free**?|
|**Would it be of if** I borrow some money?|**If it's not too much trouble, could you meet me tomorrow morning?|

There are many ways we can answer.
|giving permisson / agreeing to do it|refusing permission / refusing to do it|
|---|---|
|That's fine|*Polite*: No, sorry.|
|That's ok.|*Polite*: Sorry, I don't have any. *(giving a reason)*|
|Yes.||
|Sure.|*Strong*: No.|

*Do you mind* questions are answered differently.
|giving permisson / agreeing to do it|refusing permission / refusing to do it|
|---|---|
|That's fine||
|That's ok.|*Polite*: Sorry, I don't have any. *(giving a reason)*|
|No, not at all.|*Very strong*: Yes, I do mind.|

We follow these expressions with a verb in the *present form*. We are referring to this happening in the present-future.
> If you don't mind, could I **borrow** your car?

When we use *would* the *past form* is also possible. It depends on how you are thinking. There is a very small difference in meaning. Using the *past form* is less direct and a little more polite.
> Would it be ok if I **borrow** your car?
> - I'm thinking about borrowing your car in the future.
>
> Would it be ok if I **borrowed** your car?
> - I'm thinking hypothetically about borrowing your car.
>
> *Both questions ask if it is hypothetically ok (using would)*

### Practice
Make polite questions. Use any of the expressions above. Ask questions rather than telling people what to do or telling people what you are doing.

**Example**: I'm opening the door! <u>Do you mind if I open the door?</u>

1. Help me with something. ________
2. I'm using your phone. ________
3. Buy some milk. ________
4. Do me a favor. ________
5. I'm talking the day off tomorrow. ________
6. We're meeting at 10 tomorrow, instead of 9. ________
7. Cook dinner tonight. ________
