# Options and possibilities 3
modal verbs

## may / might
We use *may* when there are other options or possibilities. We haven't decided or are uncertain.

There are other things that may happen.
|||
|---|---|
|I **may** see you this afternoon.|I **may not** see you this afternoon.|
|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/may%20or%20might%2001.png)|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/may%20or%20might%2002.png)|

*Might* (the past form of *may*) is used in hypothetical situations. We use *might* when something is hypothetically an option or possibility; it is an option or possibility we are imagining.

|||
|---|---|
|I **might** see you this afternoon.|I **might not** see you this afternoon.|
|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/may%20or%20might%2003.png)|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/may%20or%20might%2004.png)|

When we say something is undecided or uncertain we can use either *may* or *might*.

    I may see you this afternoon. ≈ I might see you this afternoon.

|Subject|*may*|Verb|Obejct etc.||Subject|*might*|Verb|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|**may**|see|you this afternoon.|≈|I|**might**|see|you this afternoon.|
|We|**may**|arrive|early.|≈|We|**might**|arrive|early.|
|You|**may**|find|this interesting.|≈|You|**might**|find|this interesting.|
|I|**may not**|have|pasta for dinner.|≈|I|**might not**|have|pasta for dinner.|

### Which should I use?
*May* is considered slightly more likely; it refers to real possibility.

*Might* is considered slightly less likely; it refers to a possibility we are imagining.

However, it is personal preference, and you will find people using both in similar situations.

I use *might* more when speaking; I go straight from what I imagine in my mind to my mouth.

I use *may* more when writing; I take my time, and think more about what may really happen.

## may have done/might have done
We use *might have* when we know what happened.

We imagine a different possibility and a different hypothetical result.

> We **might have won** if Mason wasn't injured.
>
> ![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/may%20have%20done%20or%20might%20have%20done%2001.png)
> - In reality, Mason was injured and we lost. We are talking about a hypothetical possibility.
> - We can also say, 'We might have won if Mason hadn't been injured.'. *(See page 142.)*

We use *may have* or *might have* when we don't know exactly what happened.

We offer a possible solution, real or hypothetical. We can talk about it either way.

|||
|---|---|
|**A**: How did she get here so quickly? **B**: She **may have taken** a taxi.|**A**: How did she get here so quickly? **B**: She **might have taken** a taxi.|

|*This is a real possibility.*|*This is a hypothetical possibility. We don't know what really happened.*|

|Subject|*may/might*|*have -en*|Object etc.|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|

|He|**may**|have eaten|that last pie.||
|She|**might not**|have seen|you.||

>
> He may have eaten that last pie.
> - It is a possibility. It may have been someone else. I'm not sure.
>

## permission- can, could and may
We use *can* or *may* to give someone permission to do something.
||||
|---|---|---|
|You **can** go out tonight.|≈|You **may** go out tonight.|
|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/permission-can,%20could%20and%20may%2001.png)||![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/permission-can,%20could%20and%20may%2002.png)|
|*You have my permission. There is nothing stopping you.*||*You have my permission. I am making this option available to you.*|

|Subject|*can*|Verb|Object etc.||Subject|*may*|Verb|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|You|**can**|borrow|my phone.|≈|You|**may**|borrow|my phone.|
|You|**can**|have|some salad.|≈|You|**may**|have|some salad.|
|You|**can't**|have|chocolate.|≈|You|**may not**|have|chocolate.|

We often use *can* because *can* is a very common word, it is simple and more direct.

*May* is less direct, so we use *may* when we want to be more polite.

When we ask for permission, we use *can, could* or *may*.

||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Can** I borrow your phone?|≈|**Could** I borrow your phone?|≈|**May** I borrow your phone?|
|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/permission-can,%20could%20and%20may%2003.png)||![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/permission-can,%20could%20and%20may%2004.png)||![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/permission-can,%20could%20and%20may%2005.png)|
|*One option: I borrow your phone. Is it an option?*||*One option: I borrow your phone. Is it hypothetically an option?*||*More than one option: (a) I borrow your phone. (b) I don't borrow your phone. Is option (a) one of my options?*|

|*can*|S.|Verb|Object etc.||*could*|S.|Verb|Object etc.||*may*|S.|Verb|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Can**|I|borrow|your phone?|≈|**Could**|I|borrow|your phone?|≈|**May**|I|borrow|your phone?|
|**Can**|I|have|some salad?|≈|**Could**|I|have|some salad?|≈|**May**|I|have|some salad?|

|*more direct*|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|>|*more formal/polite*|

In some very formal situations *might* is used. 'Might I borrow your phone?'

*Might* is far ledd direct, asking if something is hypothetically one of my options.

But remember, *may* and *can* are two different words with two different meanings.

|||
|---|---|
|*Can* means something is an option or is possible. There is nothing stopping it from being an option or possibility.|*May* means there is more than one option or possibility. We use *may* to say something is undecided or uncertain.|
|**A**: It's been too long. We should see each other soon. **B**: I'm busy today, but I **can** see you tomorrow.|**A**: When will we see each other again? **B**: I **may** see you tomorrow. *(or: I **might** see you tomorrow.)*|
|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/permission-can,%20could%20and%20may%2006.png)|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/permission-can,%20could%20and%20may%2007.png)|
|*One option: Seeing each other tomorrow. It is ok with me.*|*More than one possibility: (a) seeing each other tomorrow. (b) not seeing each other tomorrow. We're not sure what will happen.*|
|I'm sorry, I'm very busy. I **can't** see you tonight.|I **may not** see you tonight.|
|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/permission-can,%20could%20and%20may%2008.png)|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/permission-can,%20could%20and%20may%2009.png)|
|*It is not possible / not an option.*|*We plan to see each other, but not seeing each other is also a possibility.*|

### Practice

## must
We use *must* when there is only one option.
> You **must** wear a seatbelt.
>
> ![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/must%2001.png)
> - Not wearing a seatbelt is unacceptable.

We add *must* when we make rules. We are very clear and direct. There is no other reasonable option. Not doing it would result in negative consequences.

|Subject|*must*|*Verb*|Object/Place/Description|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|You|must|be|home|before 10<sub>PM</sub>.|
|Staff|must|wear|uniforms.|
|Applicants|must|be|over 18 years of age.|
|Passengers|must not|use|cellphones.|

We use *must* when we have a strong option. There is only one option in our mind.
|Subject|*must*|*Verb*|Object/Place/Description|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|must|phone|my father.||
|I|mustn't|forget|the PIN number.||
|You|must|go|home|now.|

We use *must* when the subject doesn't have any other options.
|Subject|*must*|*Verb*|Object/Place/Description|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|must|breathe|to stay alive.||
|They|must|cross|the desert.||

We use *must* when there is only one reasonable possibility.
|Subject|*must*|*Verb*|Object/Place/Description|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|He|must|be|her husband.||
|It|mustn't|be|ready|yet.|

    Must only has one form: the present form, no past form.
    Must: only one option.

---

## must have done
We use *must* when there is only one possibility. We conclude what happened in the past based on what we see or hear in the present.
> A: How did she get here so quickly?
> B: She **must have taken** a taxi.
>
> ![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/must%20have%20done%2001.png)
> - This is the only reasonable explanation.
> - We make our conclusion based on what we heard or saw: she got here quickly.

|Subject|*must*|*have -en*|Object/Description|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|The package|**must**|have arrived||by now.|
|He|**must**|have eaten|that last pie.||
|She|*mustn't**|have seen|you.||
> The package **must have** arrived by now.
> - We sent it a long time ago. This is the only reasonable explanation.
>
> He **must have** eaten that last pie.
> - There is no one else here that could have eaten it. This is the only resonable explanation.
>
> She **mustn't have** seen you.
> - If she saw you she would have said "Hello". She isn't rude. This is the only reasonable explanation.

### Practice

## must/have to
In many situations, *have to* or *must* can both be used.

*Have to* refers to a task given to a person to do. They may have given themself the task or someone else may have given them the task.

![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/must%20or%20have%20to%2001.png)

|Subject|*have to*|*Verb*|Object/Place/Description|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|You|**have to**|be|home|before 10<sub>PM</sub>.|
|Staff|**have to**|wear|uniforms.||
|Applicants|**have to**|be|over 18 years of age.||
|I|**have to**|phone|my father.||
|I|**have to**|remember|the PIN number.||
|She|**have to**|go|home.||

*Must* shows that there are no other options. It is very clear and direct so it sounds stronger. If it does not happen, there will be negative consequences.
|Subject|*must*|*Verb*|Object/Place/Description|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|You|**must**|be|home|before 10<sub>PM</sub>.|
|Staff|**must**|wear|uniforms.||
|Applicants|**must**|be|over 18 years of age.||
|I|**must**|phone|my father.||
|I|**must**|remember|the PIN number.||
|She|**must**|go|home.||

*Must* is more serious than *have (to do something)*.
> I **must** work tomorrow.
> - If I don't work tomorrow there will be negative condsequences.
>
> I **have to** work tomorrow.
> - This is the shift I've been given. In most situations this is better.

We also use *have got to* when speaking casually. *(See page 81.)*
> I **'ve got to** work tomorrow.

### Which should I use?
*Must* is used more in formal situations and writing. We think about it more and decide there are no other options.

*Have to* is used more in speaking. We also use *have to* when someone tells us what to do. "I have to wear a tie at work" - someone has decided that I do this but in my mind this is not the only option.

*Have got to* is also used in speaking and is very common in casual speech. We use *gotta* for short.

## mustn't/don't have to
In negative sentences, *have to* and *must* have very different meanings.

*Don't have to* shows a person hasn't been given the task to do. So, it is ok if they do it or if they don't do it.

![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/mustn't%20or%20don't%20have%20to%2001.png)

|Subject|*don't have to*|*Verb*|Object/Place/Description|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|You|**don't have to**|be|home|before 10<sub>PM</sub>.|
|Staff|**don't have to**|wear|uniforms.||
|Applicants|**don't have to**|be|over 18 years of age.||
|I|**don't have to**|phone|my father.||
|I|**don't have to**|remember|the PIN number.||
|She|**doesn't have to**|go|home.||

*Must not* shows that there are no other options. If it does happen, there will be negative consequences. It is ***not*** ok if the person does it.
|Subject|*don't have to*|*Verb*|Object/Place/Description|Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|You|**mustn't**|be|home|before 10<sub>PM</sub>.|
|Staff|**mustn't**|wear|uniforms.||
|Applicants|**mustn't**|be|over 18 years of age.||
|I|**mustn't**|phone|my father.||
|I|**mustn't**|remember|the PIN number.||
|She|**mustn't**|go|home.||

*Mustn't* and *don't have to* have different meanings.
> I **mustn't** work tomorrow.
> - If I work tomorrow there will be negative consequences.
>
> I **don't have to** work tomorrow.
> - It's ok if I stay home.

### Practice
Complete the sentences with *must, have to, have got to, mustn't* or *don't have to* using the verb in brackets. There may be more than one answer.

1. You ____ (be) here on time tomorrow.
2. conversation

   - B: You ____ (not bring) anything. We've got it covered.

## making deductions
We use *must* when we make deductions. Our conclusion is the only reasonable possibility.

![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/making%20deductions%2001.png)
> A: I haven't eaten since this morning. B: You **must** be hungry.
>
> Phillip isn't here. The train **must** have been delayed.

We use *can't (can not)* when we deduce that something is not possible. Based on what I know, I don't believe it is possible.

![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/making%20deductions%2002.png)

> You've just eaten a whole pizza! You **can't** be hungry.
>
> Emma takes the same train as Phillip. She's here so the train **can't** have been delayed.

We are sometimes unsure. We use *may* or *might* to say something is one of many possibilities.

![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/making%20deductions%2003.png)
> We should prepare some food. The guests **might** be hungry.
>
> Phillip isn't here. The train **might** have been delayed.
>
> We should prepare some food. The guests **may** be hungry.
>
> Phillip isn't here. The train **may** have been delayed.

We often combine *may* and *be* into one word and put it first.
> **Maybe** the guests are hungry. = The guests **may be** hungry.
>
> **Maybe** the train has been delayed. = The train **may** have **been** delayed.
>
> **Maybe** they're rich. = They **may be** rich.

When we are unsure we can also use *could* to say something is hypothetically possible.
> We should prepare some food. The guest **could** be hungry.
>
> Phillip isn't here. The train **could** have been delayed.

---

## had better
*Must* has no *past form*, so when we want to speak about what is hypothetically the only option or possibility we use *had better*.
> You **'d better* wear a seat belt.
>
> ![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/had%20better%2001.png)
> - This is hypothetically the only reasonable option. We imagine that there would negative consequences if you didn't wear your seatbelt, so not wearing a seatbelt would be unacceptable.

*Must, had better* and *should* are often used in similar situations.
||||
|---|---|---|
|You **must** wear a seatbelt.|You **'d better** wear a seatbelt.|You **should** wear a seatbelt.|
|*Not wearing a seatbelt is unacceptable.*|*Hypothetically speaking: not wearing a seatbelt would be unacceptable.*|*Wearing a seatbelt is hypothetically the right thing to do.*|
|strong|---------------------------------->|soft|

We use *had better* to talk about options or possibilities. This is the only reasonable option or possbility that fits with what we are imagining.
|||
|---|---|
|I **'d better** go soon.|Oliver is running late. (knock knock) That **'d better** be him.|
|*This is hypothetically my only option. ≈ I need to go soon. If I don't go soon, the plan I am imagining is not going to happen.*|*This is hypothetically the only possibility. If the person at the door is not Oliver, the plan I am imagining is not going to happen.*|

### Why do we use two words?
There is no single word that has this meaning so the meanings of *had* and *better* are combined.

||||
|---|---|---|
|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/had%20better%2002.png)|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/had%20better%2003.png)|![](./15.%20Options%20and%20possibilities%203/had%20better%2004.png)|
|We use *have* because the subject **has to do** something or something **has to be true** to fit in with what we are imagining.|We use the past form (*had*) because we are thinking **hypothetically**.|We use better because we consider and **compare** options and possibilities.|

We also use *had better not*.
|||
|---|---|
|He **'d better not** say anything.|He **'d better not** be late.|
|*Not saying anything is the better option.*|*Not being late the better possibility.*|
