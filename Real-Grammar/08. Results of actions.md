# Results of actions
perfect aspect

## -en form
### What is it?
Many common verbs have an *-en form*. These words end in *-en, ne* or *-n*.

|present form|past form|-ing form|*-en form*|
|---|---|---|---|
|eat|ate|eating|*eaten*|
|do|did|doing|*done*|
|know|knew|knowing|*known*|

Some verbs change vowels for their different forms and have a *u* (*n* upside-down) for the *-en form*.

|present form|past form|-ing form|*-en form (u)*|
|---|---|---|---|
|drink|drank|drinking|*drunk*|
|swim|swam|swimming|*swum*|

However, **most verbs don't have a separate *-en from***. We use the same form as the *past form*.

|present form|past form|-ing form|*-en meaning*|
|---|---|---|---|
|wash|washed|washing|*washed*|
|have|had|having|*had*|
|love|loved|loving|*loved*|

We know it has the meaning of the *-en form* because of where it is used in the sentence, often after *have*. *(The **past form** is used directly after the subject.)*

> I **washed** the car yesterday. *(past form)*
>
> I've **washed** the car. *(-en form meaning)*

### What does it mean?

![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2001.png)

We use the *-en form* to shift focus away from an action.

Details of the action, such as when it happened, are not important.

We use *have* and the *-en form* to focus on the **result** of an aciton.

### How do we use it?

We often use it with *have*. We have results in the present.

|||
|---|---|
|We talk about **recently completed actions**.|We talk about **experiences**.|
|I ***have eaten*** breakfast.|I ***have lived*** in England.|
|![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2002.png)|![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2003.png)
|*Breakfast is complete.*|*I lived in England sometime in the past.*|
|*When it happened isn't important.*|*When it happened isn't important.*|
|*The result is important: I don't need to eat now.*|*The result is important: I have the experience now.*|

We are talking about the present. If we say when, we add a time that includes the present.

|||
|---|---|
|I ***have eaten*** breakfast *today*.|I ***have lived*** in England *this year*.|

|*Recently completed actions*|*Experiences*|
|---|---|
|I've eaten.|He's played soccer.|
|She's had breakfast.|We've lived in London.|
|They've cooked dinner.|They've worked in a shop.|

![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2004.png)

We use *have* with the *-en form*.

> The present form of *have* shows us this is in the **present-future**.
>
> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2005.png)
> 
> We are talking about what we have **now**, in the **present**.

|Subject|*have*|*Verb*|Object|Place|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|**have**|**eaten**|eggs.||We've eaten eggs.|
|She|**has**|**worked**||in a bank.|She's worked in a bank.|
|I|**have**|**lived**||in Sweden.|I've lived in Sweden.|
|He|**has**|**had**|breakfast.||He's had breakfast.|
|You|**have**|**played**|soccer.||You've played soccer.|

> The *-en form* focuses on the **results** of actions.
>
> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2006.png)
>
> Exactly when it happened is not important.

We put *have* first to make it a question.

|*have*|Subject|*Verb*|Object|Place|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Have**|you|**eaten**|eggs?||Have you eaten eggs?|
|**Has**|she|**worked**||in a bank?|Has she worked in a bank?|
|**Have**|you|**lived**||in Sweden?|Have you lived in Sweden?|
|**Has**|he|**had**|breakfast?||Has he had breakfast?|
|**Have**|you|**played**|soccer?||Have you played soccer?|

We add *not* after *have* to make it negative.

|Subject|*have*|*Verb*|Object|Place|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|**haven't**|**eaten**|eggs.||We haven't eaten eggs.|
|She|**hasn't**|**worked**||in a bank.|She hasn't worked in a bank.|
|I|**haven't**|**lived**||in Sweden.|I haven't lived in Sweden.|
|He|**hasn't**|**had**|breakfast.||He hasn't had breakfast.|
|You|**haven't**|**played**|soccer.||You haven't played soccer.|

*Been* and *gone* are used when we talk about people going places.

|||
|---|---|
|When we use *been* the person **was** somewhere or **was** doing something. They are not there or doing it now.|When we use *gone* the person **went** somewhere so we **don't know** exactly **where** they are now.|
|![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2007.png)|![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2008.png)|
|He's ***been*** fishing.|He's ***gone*** fishing.|
|*He **was fishing** sometime in the past.*|*He **went fishing** sometime in the past.*|
|***He isn't fishing now.***|***He isn't here now.***|
|She's ***been*** to Seoul.|She's ***gone*** to Seoul.|
|*She went **to Seoul** sometime in the past.*|*She **went to Seoul** sometime in the past.*|
|*She **was** in Seoul. **She isn't in Seoul now.***|***She isn't here now.***|

### Practice
Complete the sentences using *have* and the *-en form*.

**Example**: I <u>haven't eaten</u> (not eat) breakfast yet.

1. ____ (you play) golf?
2. I ____ (send) you a letter.
3. ____ (you be) to Europe?
4. ____ (you hear) the news?
5. She ____ (not live) in South Africa.
6. I watched The Shawshank Redemption last night. ____ (you see) it?

## adding a length of time

When we talk about experiences, we can add a time period to show how much experience we have. This is the amount of experience we currently have in the present. We often assume we are still gaining experience in these things.

![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/adding%20a%20length%20of%20time%2001.png)

|Subject|*have*|*Verb*|Object|Place/Time|*Time period*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|She|**has**|**worked**||in a bank|**for seven years**.|
|It|**has**|rained|||**for the last few days.**|
|I|**have**|**lived**||in Sweden|**since 2010**.|
|He|**has**|**played**|soccer||**since he was five**.|
|It|**has**|**been**||a while|***since I've seen you***.|

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/adding%20a%20length%20of%20time%2002.png)
>
> *How long* **has** she **worked** in a bank? She's worked in a bank for seven years.
> - She started working in the bank seven years ago. She still works there now.
>
> It **'s rained** for the last few days.
> - It started raining a few days ago. It is still raining now.
>
> *How long* **have** you **lived** in Sweden? I've lived in Sweden sicne 2010.
> - I moved to Sweden in 2010. I still live there now.
>
> He's a good soccer player. He **'s played** *soccer* since he was five.
> - He started playing soccer when he was five. He still plays soccer now.
>
> It **'s been** a while since I've seen you.
> - I haven't seen you for some time.

This pattern is also used for *recently completed actions*. We often add a time period when we think the action has happened for long enough and we want it to end now.

|Subject|*have*|*Verb*|Object|Place/Time|*Time period*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|**have**|**waited**|||**for tow hours**.|
|I|**have**|**cooked**||every night|**for three months**.|
|He|**hasn't**|**eaten**|anything||**since Monday**.|

> I **'ve waited** *for two hours**.
> - It's too long.
>
> I **'ve cooked** every night *for three months*.
> - Can you do the cooking for a change?
>
> He **hasn't eaten** anything *since Monday*.
> - He really should eat something.

### Practice
Complete the conversation.

    A: Nice house! How long ____ you ____ (live) here?
    B: I ____ (live) here ____ about three years.
    A: You have a piano! Do you play it?
    B: Yes, I ____ (play) it ____ I was a child. I love it.

## ever and never

When we want to make it clear we are talking about experiences, we use *ever* with questions and *never* with negatives. *(never means not ever)*

When we are obviously talking about experiences we don't need *ever* and *never*, but we can use them to be clear. Either way is ok.

|Experiences|Experiences|
|---|---|
|Has he played soccer?|Has he **ever** played soccer?|
|He hasn't played soccer.|He's **never** played soccer.|
|Have you lived in London?|Have you **ever** lived in London?|
|We haven't lived in London.|We've **never** lived in London.|
|Have they worked in a shop?|Have they **ever** worked in a shop?|
|They haven't worked in a shop.|They've **never** worked in a shop.|

We can add *ever* and *never* to make it clear we are talking about an experience, and not a recently completed action.

|Recently complete actions|*Experiences*|
|---|---|
|Have you cooked dinner?|Have you **ever** cooked dinner?|
|I haven't cooked dinner.|I've **never** cooked dinner. My wife always cooks.|
|Have you cooked dinner? *(today) Or do I need to buy something for dinner?*|Have you **ever** cooked dinner? *at any time in your life*|
|I haven't cooked dinner. *(not today) I often cook.*|I've **never** cooked dinner. *not even once*|

### Practice 
Complete the conversation using *have* and the *-en form*. Use *ever* and *never* if you can.

**Example**: A: I'm hungry. I haven't eaten (not eat) since breakfast.

    B: I ____ (not eat) either.
    A: Do you want to get something to eat?
    B: Sure, ____ you ____ (have) Mexican food?
    A: Yes. I ____ (have) tacos.
    B: Have you ____ (have) a burrito?
    A: No. I ____ (have) one.
    B: They're really good. There's a good burrito place near here.
    A: Ok, let's go there.

## already and yet

We use *already* to emphasize that something happened at a point in time before now, before the time we are talking about, or before we expected.

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2001.png)
>
> I've **already** done the dishes.
> - I did the dishes sometime before now.
>
> When we got home it was **already** dark.
> - It got dark before we got home.
>
> Oh, you're here **already**!
> - You are here earlier than I expected.
>
> Are you at work **already**?
> - I didn't expect you to be there now.

*Yet* is similar to *already*, but *yet* refers to the period of time up to now.

We often use *yet* in **questions** and **negatives** statements.

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2002.png)
>
> Hava you finished **yet**?
> - sometime up to now
>
> I haven't seen the movie **yet**.
> - not at any time up to now
>
> It's the best **yet**.
> - the best up to now. There may be a better one later.

*Already* shows something is done, it is not happening later.

*Not yet* shows something is not done, it is happening later.

Using *yet* in a question asks if something is done, or if it is happening later.

We sometimes use *already* or *yet*, and sometimes don't. It depends on the situation.

|*-en form only*|*-en form with already or yet*|
|---|---|
|![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2003.png)|![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2004.png)|
|Teacher: Have you done your homework? - Student: Yes, I've done it.|Mother: Do you homework. - Child: I've **already** done it.|
*The student completed their homework on time. It is due **now**. It could **not** have happened **later***.|The child did the homework **before** now. Doing it **later** would have been ok.|
|Teacher: Have you done your homework? - Student: No, I haven't done it.|Mother: Do you homework. - Child: No, **not yet**.|
|*The student didn't complete their homework on time. It is due **now**. It can **not** happen **later**.|The child hasn't done their homework. The child will do it **later**.|

### Practice
Complete the conversation using *already* or *yet*.

**Example**: A: It's <u>already</u> the 26th! Not long to go.

    A: Have you renewed your passport ____ ?
    B: Yes, I have and I've ____ got a visa.
    A: You got the visa ____ ? That was quick.
    B: Yeah. Have you booked the flights and the hotel ____ ?
    A: Well, I've booked the flights but I haven't booked the hotel ____.
    B: The flights were easy because they ____ had our details from when we booked last time.

### Compare *hava/has + -en form* and the *past form*.

We use the *have/has + -en form* to talk about results we have in the present.

We use the *past form* to talk about a specific time in the past.

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2005.png)
>
> I **'ve been** to Africa.
>
> He **hasn't eaten** lunch.
> - (not yet: he may eat it in the future)
>
> **Have** you **done** your homework?

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2006.png)
>
> I **went** to Africa *last year*.
>
> He **didn't eat** lunch *yesterday*.
> - Lunch time was in the past.
>
> **Did** you **do** your homework?
> - in the recent past

We often ask questions with the *hava/has + -en form*. We don't know which time in the past to talk about so we talk about the present. We then use the *past form* to get the specific details.

> A: **Hava** you **been** to Africa?
> - interested in experience that you have in the present
>
> B: Yes, I **went** there last year.
> - giving details about when I got this experience: in the past

We use the *have/has + -en form* with a period of time up to the present.

We use the *past form* to talk about a period of time that finished in the past.

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2007.png)
>
> She **has worked** here *for a year*.
> - She works here now.
>
> He **hasn't eaten** *since yesterday*.
>
> **Have** you **lived** here *for more than a year*?

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2008.png)
>
> She **worked** here *for a year*.
> - finished: she doesn't work here now
>
> He **didn't** eat *for three days*.
> - in the past: he eats again now
>
> **Did** you stay there *for more than a week*?

### Practice

    B: No, I haven't, but I ____ (save) a dog's life.
    A: What ____ (you do)?
    B: I ____ (pull) it out of the path of a moving car.


### Compare *have/has + -en form* and the *present form*.

We use the *have/has + -en form* to talk about **specific experiences** *(results we have in the present.)*.

We use the *present form** to talk about things **generally**.

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2009.png)
>
> I **'ve** been to Africa.
> - maybe once
>
> He **hasn't played** baseball.
> - not yet: he may do it in the future.
>
> **Hava** you ever **eaten** insects? 
> - maybe once

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2010.png)
>
> I often **go** to Africa.
> - generally: many times
>
> He **doesn't** play baseball.
> - this generally doesn't happen
>
> **Do** you eat insects?
> - generally: many times

We often talk about what generally happens then more specifically about experiences in the same conversation.

> A: **Do** you ski?
> - present form
>
> B: Yes.
>
> A: **Hava** you ever **skied** in Europe?
> - have/has + -en form

    B: No, thanks, I ____ (just buy) a new car too.

### Compare *have/has + -en form* and *am/is/are + -ing form*.

We use *have/has + -en form* for **recently completed actions**.

We use *am/is/are + -ing form* for unfinished, but **soon to be completed actions**.

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2011.png)
>
> I **'ve** fixed the door.
>
> I **haven't mopped** the floor.

> - started or not started.
>
> I **'m not fixing** the door. It isn't broken.
>
> **Are** you **washing** the windows?
> - I hope you plan to do it soon.

We use *have/has + -en form* for **experiences** we have in the present.

We use *am/is/are + -ing form* for things that are unfinished: **defined future experiences**.

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2013.png)
>

>
> I **'m not going** to Salt Lake City.

We use *have/has + -en form* with *for* or *since* to talk about a period of time up to **now**.

We use *am/is/are + -ing form* with *for* to talk about periods of time from start to **end**.

> ![](./static-resource/08.%20Results%20of%20actions/already%20and%20yet%2015.png)
