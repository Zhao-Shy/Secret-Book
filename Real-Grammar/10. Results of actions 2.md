## have got / have

*Got* is the past form of *get*. We use *have got (have + -en form meaning)* in many of the same situations we use *have*. Both of these sentences are referring to the present.

||Subject|*have*|*Verb(got)*|Object|Place|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||We|**have**|**got**|eggs.||We've got eggs.|
|Hava|you||**got**|a soccer ball?||Hava you got a soccer ball?|
||He|**has**|**got**|blue eyes.||He's got blue eyes.|

Everything has a beginning. We get something, then we have it. We use either *have got* or *have*.

> We **'ve got** eggs. = We **have** eggs.
>
> **Have** you **got** a soccer ball? = **Do** you **have** a soccer ball?
>
> He **'s got** blue eyes. = He **has** blue eyes.
> - He got his blue eyes from this mother.

However, there is a different in how we use *have got* and *have*.

|||
|---|---|
|*Have got* refers to things we got in the past and have in the present.|*Hava* may refer to things we have in the present or things that generally happen (many times).
|What **have** you **got** for lunch?|What do you **have** for lunch?|
|*your lunch today*|***generally**: every day / your lunch today*|

### Practice
Complete the sentences using *have*. Then complete each sentence again using *have got*.

|||
|---|---|
|I <u>have</u> a car.|I <u>'ve got</u> a car.|
|My brother ____ a boat.|My brother ____ a boat.|
|We ____ (not) a jet ski.|We ____ (not) a jet ski.|
|We ____ a daughter.|We ____ a daughter.|
|____ you ____ a sister?|____ you ____ a sister?|

## have done / have to do
Here we have a 'to do' list. The items that are crossed out are complete. The items that are not crossed out are important, but not complete, so we *-have-to do-* then in the present-future.

||I|**have**|**to**|**wash**|my hair.||I have to wash my hair.|

||They|**have**|**to**|**work**||tomorrow.|They have to work tomorrow.|
|Do|you|**have**|**to**|**go**?|||Do you have to go?|

Either *have to* or *have got to* can be used.

||Subejct|*Verb*||*Verb*|Object|Place/Time|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|||***have got***|***to***|***(goal)***||||
||I|**have got**|**to**|**wash**|my hair.||I've got to wash my hair.|
||She|**has got**|**to**|**leave**|the party|early.|She's got to leave the party early.|
||They|**have got**|**to**|**work**||tomorrow.|They've got to work tomorrow.|
|**Have**|you|**got**|**to**|**go**?|||Have you got to go?|

> People often say *gotta* instead of *got to*. We use *have to* in formal English.

We can use these patterns to describe anything that is necessary or must be done.

### Practice
Complete the sentences using *have* with the *-en form* and *have to (verb)*. Using *have got to (verb)* is fine too.

    A: How are the preparations for our Asia trip coming along?
    B: Good. How about you? ___ you ____ (get) your passport?
    A: Not yet. ____ I ____ (get) a visa too?
    B: Yes. You ____ (get) a visa for China.
    A: Ok. ____ you ____ (book) the flights and the hotel?
    B: I ____ (book) the flights but I ____ (still)(book) the hotel.
    A: Ok then.
