# Results of actions 2
perfect aspect

## have got / have

*Got* is the past form of *get*. We use *have got (have + -en form meaning)* in many of the same situations we use *have*. Both of these sentences are referring to the present.

|She **'s got** a hat.|=|She **has** a hat.|

||Subject|*have*|*Verb(got)*|Object|Place|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||We|**have**|**got**|eggs.||We've got eggs.|
|Hava|you||**got**|a soccer ball?||Hava you got a soccer ball?|
||He|**has**|**got**|blue eyes.||He's got blue eyes.|

Everything has a beginning. We get something, then we have it. We use either *have got* or *have*.

> We **'ve got** eggs. = We **have** eggs.
>
> **Have** you **got** a soccer ball? = **Do** you **have** a soccer ball?
>
> He **'s got** blue eyes. = He **has** blue eyes.
> - He got his blue eyes from this mother.

However, there is a different in how we use *have got* and *have*.

|||
|---|---|
|*Have got* refers to things we got in the past and have in the present.|*Hava* may refer to things we have in the present or things that generally happen (many times).
|What **have** you **got** for lunch?|What do you **have** for lunch?|
|*your lunch today*|***generally**: every day / your lunch today*|

### Practice
Complete the sentences using *have*. Then complete each sentence again using *have got*.

|||
|---|---|
|I <u>have</u> a car.|I <u>'ve got</u> a car.|
|My brother ____ a boat.|My brother ____ a boat.|
|We ____ (not) a jet ski.|We ____ (not) a jet ski.|
|We ____ a daughter.|We ____ a daughter.|
|____ you ____ a sister?|____ you ____ a sister?|

## have done / have to do
Here we have a 'to do' list. The items that are crossed out are complete. The items that are not crossed out are important, but not complete, so we *-have-to do-* then in the present-future.

![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/have%20done%20or%20have%20to%20do%2001.png)

||She|**has**|**to**|**leave**|the party|early.|She has to leave the party early.|
||They|**have**|**to**|**work**||tomorrow.|They have to work tomorrow.|
|Do|you|**have**|**to**|**go**?|||Do you have to go?|

Either *have to* or *have got to* can be used.

||Subejct|*Verb*||*Verb*|Object|Place/Time|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|||***have got***|***to***|***(goal)***||||
||I|**have got**|**to**|**wash**|my hair.||I've got to wash my hair.|
||She|**has got**|**to**|**leave**|the party|early.|She's got to leave the party early.|
||They|**have got**|**to**|**work**||tomorrow.|They've got to work tomorrow.|
|**Have**|you|**got**|**to**|**go**?|||Have you got to go?|

> People often say *gotta* instead of *got to*. We use *have to* in formal English.

We can use these patterns to describe anything that is necessary or must be done.

### Practice
Complete the sentences using *have* with the *-en form* and *have to (verb)*. Using *have got to (verb)* is fine too.

    A: How are the preparations for our Asia trip coming along?
    B: Good. How about you? ___ you ____ (get) your passport?
    A: Not yet. ____ I ____ (get) a visa too?
    B: Yes. You ____ (get) a visa for China.
    A: Ok. ____ you ____ (book) the flights and the hotel?
    B: I ____ (book) the flights but I ____ (still)(book) the hotel.
    A: Ok then.

## adding to

|---|---|---|
|We use *to* to connect two places in sequence.|We use *to* to connect two verbs in sequence.|We can connect as many as we like.|
|![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/adding%20to%2001.png)|![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/adding%20to%2002.png)|![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/adding%20to%2003.png)|

Some verbs *(such as **have, got, want** and **need**)* are often used with *to* before another verb.
|Subject|*Verb 1*||*Verb 2*|Object|Place/Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||***Verb(now)***|**to**|**(goal)**|||
|We|**have**|**to**|**buy**|food.||
|She|**has got**|**to**|**go**.|||
|I|**want**|**to**|**help**|you.||
|They|**need**|**to**|**work**||tomorrow.|
|She|**offered**|**to**|**do**|the gardening.||
|I|**promise**|**to**|**take**|you|swimming.|

> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/adding%20to%2004.png) We are talking about things happening in sequence.
>
> We **have** to **buy** food.
> - 1. We **have** the task.
> - 2. We **buy** food.
>
> She **'s got** to **go**.
> - 1. She **has got** the task.
> - 2. She **goes**.
>
> I **want** to **help** you.
> - 1. I **want** it.
> - 2. I do it; I **help** you.
>
> They **need** to **work** tomorrow.
> - 1. They **need** it.
> - 2. They do it; they **work** tomorrow.
>
> She **offered** to **do** the gardening.
> - 1. She **offered**.
> - 2. She (possibly) **does** it.
>
> I **promise** to **take** you swimming.
> - 1. I **promise**
> - 2. I do it; I **take** you swimming.

### Practice
Add *to* only where needed. Leave other spaces blank.

**Example**: I ____ want <u>to</u> buy a hamster.

1. He ____ has ____ go home.
2. She ____ wants ____ a rabbit.
3. They ____ jog ____ keep fit.
4. We ____ want ____ learn ____ speak English.

When we use verbs in this way, each verb may have an object.
|Subject|*Verb 1*||||*Verb 2*|*Object/Description*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||***(not)***|***Verb***|***Object***|***to***|***(goal)***|
|I|**don't**|**have**|money|**to**|**buy**|clothes.|
|We||**have**|conversations|**to**|**practice**|English.|

Some common expressions are formed with *be*, a description, and *to*, and used before a verb. These expressions give us information relating to the goal.

|Subject|*Expression*|||*Verb*|Object/Description|Place/Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||***be***|***Description***|***to***|***(goal)***|||
|I|**am**|**supposed**|**to**|**work**||on Friday.|
|He|**was**|**able**|**to**|**find**|a job.||
|It|**is**|**bound**|**to**|**be**|good.||
|It|**is**|**about**|**to**|**rain**.|||
|The President|**is**||**to**|**visit**|Africa|next month.|

We add verbs with *to* to sentences with verbs in the *-ing form* and *-en form* too.

|Subject|*Verb 1*|||*Verb 2*|Object|Place/Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|||***Verb***|***to***|***(goal)***|||
|I|**hava**|**decided**|**to**|**go**||to Africa.|
|I|**am**|**planning**|**to**|**go**||next year.|
|They|**haven't**|**come**|**to**|**get**|the car|yet.|
|They|**are**|**coming**|**to**|**get**|the cat|on Tuesday.|
|We|**are**|**going**|**to**|**have**|a barbecue.||

The actions and events after *to* happen in the future. We often use this pattern with *be going to* to talk about the future. *(See page 153.)*

### Practice
Combine the sentences using *to*.

1. *Now*: He eats vegetables. *Goal*: He loses weight. <u>He eats vegetables to lose weight.</u>
2. *Now*: I am trying. *Goal*: I find a solution. ________.
3. *Now*: They have gone. *Goal*: They get some milk. ________.
4. *Now*: We're about... *Goal*: We go home. ________.
5. *Now*: I have... *Goal*: work tomorrow. ________.

## to or -ing?

Some verbs are often used when we talk about **two** things happening in sequence. We use *to*.
|Subject|*Verb 1*|*to*|*Verb 2*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|**want**|**to**|**go**|snorkeling.|
|She|**is learning**|**to**|**drive**.||
|We|**'ve decided**|**to**|**take**|a holiday.|

> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/to%20or%20-ing%2001.png)
>
> I **want** to **go** snorkeling.
> - I **want** it.
> - I (possibly) **go** snorkeling.
>
> She **is learning** to **drive**.
> - She **learns**.
> - She **drives**.
>
> We **'ve decided** to **take** a holiday.
> - We **decide**.
> - We **take** a holiday.

Some verbs talk about one thing happening. We use the *-ing form* as the object. *(Page 67.)*

|Subject|*Verb*|*Object(activity)*|
|---|---|---|
|I|**enjoy**|**walking**.|
|She|**is practicing**|**parking**.|
|We|**considered**|**going to Egypt**.|

> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/to%20or%20-ing%2002.png)
>
> The object is the thing that we *enjoy, are practicing, considered* etc.
>
> The object often doesn't end in *-ing*.
>
> I enjoy **walks** in the park.
>
> She is practicing **the piano**.
>
> We considered **the option**.

The meaning of the first verb is important. Some verbs go with *to*, some with *-ing*, some with either.

In some situations, some verbs can be followed by a verb with *to* or an activity(*-ing form*).

The overall meaning is the same.
|Subject|*Verb 1*|*to*|*Verb 2*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|**love**|**to**|**sing**.||
|She|**likes**|**to**|**go**|to Europe.|

> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/to%20or%20-ing%2001.png)
>
> I **love** to **sing**.
> - Reason: 
>   - I **love** it.
>   - What I do: I **sing**.

|Subject|*Verb*|*Object(activity)*|
|---|---|---|
|I|**love**|**singing**.|
|She|**likes**|**going to Europe**.|

> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/to%20or%20-ing%2002.png)
>
> I **love** **singing**.
> - Singing is the thing I love.

Sometimes only one option fits.

|Subject|*Verb 1*|*to*|*Verb 2*|Object etc.|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|**like**|**to**|**close**|the windows.|

> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/to%20or%20-ing%2001.png)
>
> Before I go out, I **like** to **close** the windows.
> - Reason: I **like** having the windows closed.
> - What I do: I **close** the windows.
>
> I like having the windows closed so I close them. Closing windows is **not** my hobby.

|Subject|*Verb*|*Object(activity)*|
|---|---|---|
|I|**like**|**living in Melbourne**.|

> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/to%20or%20-ing%2002.png)
>
> I **like living** in Melbourne.
>
> I like this one thing: living where I live. It is **not** an **activity** that I do from time to time. It is something permanent.

Sometimes the meaning is different in different situations.

|||
|---|---|
|A: What do you do fun?|A: Do you like the Winter Olympics?|
|B: I love to figure skate. *(I love it. I do it.)*|B: Yes, I love figure skating. *(I love the sport.)*|
|*or*: ||
|B: I love figure skating. *(I love the sport.)*|*Many people who love the sport don't actually do it. They love watching it.*|
|*We assume I do it because of the context. = I love to figure skate. (in this situation)*

Sometimes the meaning is completely different.

|Subject|*Verb 1*|*to*|*Verb 2*|Object etc.||Subject|*Verb*|*Object(activity)*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|**stopped**|**to**|**talk**|to Michelle.||I|**stopped**|**talking to Michelle**.|

|||

|Two things happening in sequence.|One thing I stopped:|
|*1. I **stopped** doing what I was doing. 2. I **talked** to Michelle.*|*talking to Michelle. We often talked in the past but I do not talk to her anymore.*|
|||
|---|---|
|**Remember to lock** the door before you leave.|Where's my key? I **remember locking** the door, so I had it when I left.|
|*I will lock the door in the future. 1. Remember. 2. Lock the door.*|*One thing I remember: I locked the door.*|
|||
|I **tried to open** the window, but it was stuck.|It's so hot. I **tried opening** the window but it didn't help.|
|*I couldn't get the window open.*|*One thing I tried:*|
|*1. I try. 2. Goal: open the window - It was stuck so I didn't reach my goal.*|*I opened the window, but the house was still hot.*|
|||
|We **regert to inform** you that your services are no longer required.|I **regret** not **studying** harder.|
|*1. We feel I regret because your services are no longer required. 2. We inform you.*|*One thing I regret in the past: I feel regret because I didn't study hard enough.*|

### Practice
Complete the sentences with a *verb* (with *to*) or a *noun* (a verb in the *-ing form*). There may be more than one answer.

1. I promise ____ (help) you.
2. I recommend ____ (go) to the museum.
3. Sorry, I forgot ____ (get) a cake.
4. I don't like ____ (run).
5. Keep ____ (go).
6. What will they choose ____ (do)?
7. We're planning ____ (go) to the theater.
8. Stop ____ (write) and hand in your exam!

## results in the past

We talk about results in the past the same way we talk about results in the present(*have* and the *-en form* - See page 70). We use *had*(past of *have*) to show we are talking about a time in the past.

|||
|---|---|
|I **had eaten** breakfast.|I **had lived** in England.|
|![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/results%20in%20the%20past%2001.png)|![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/results%20in%20the%20past%2002.png)|

We add **more information** so the listener knows when we are referring to.

> I ***'d eaten*** a big breakfast **so I wasn't hungry at lunch time**.
> - *referring to lunch time: in the past.*
> - **I wasn't hungry at lunch time**. I ***'d eaten*** a big breakfast.
>
> I ***'d lived*** in England **so I was comfortable speaking English in America**.
> - **I lived in America last year**. I ***'d lived*** in England before that.

We use *had* with the *-en form*.

> *Had* is used because we are talking about what we had at a time in the **past**.
>
> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/results%20in%20the%20past%2003.png)

|Subject|*have*|*Verb(-en)*|Object|Place||
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|She|**had**|**worked**||in a bank.|before she got her current banking job.|
|I|**had**|**lived**||in Sweden|so I knew a little Swedish.|
|He|**had**|**had**|breakfast||so he didn't eat anything.|
|You|**had**|**played**|soccer||before Ashley became your coach.|

> The *-en form* focuses on the **results** of actions.
> 
> Exactly when it happened is not important.
>
> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/results%20in%20the%20past%2003.png)

We use this pattern to talk about results at a time in the past. These things happened before the time we are referring to. We can talk about experiences or actions.

|Experiences|
|---|
|He was much better than the other players because they were beginners but he **'d played** soccer before. |
|The new employee was very slow because he **hadn't worked** in a shop before.|
|A: We went to the USA last year. B: Great, **had** you **been** there before?|

|Actions|
|---|
|Dave offered me a sandwich yesterday but I wasn't hungry because I **'d** already **eaten**.|
|I made her lunch. She was very hungry because she **hadn't had** breakfast.|
|So you got home at 6PM, **had** they **cooked** dinner?|


### Adding a time
When we talk about experiences, we can add time information to show how much experience we had. This is the amount of experience we had at that time in the past. People often continued gaining experience in these things.

![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/results%20in%20the%20past%2005.png)

|Subject|*have*|*Verb(-en)*|Object|Place|*Time period*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|She|**had**|**worked**||in a bank|**for seven years**.|
|I|**had**|**lived**||in Sweden|**for ten years**.|
|He|**had**|**played**|soccer||**since he was five**.|

> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/results%20in%20the%20past%2006.png)
>
> She **'d worked** in the bank *for seven years* so the boss offered her a promotion.
>
> I **'d lived** in Sweden *for ten years* and decided it was time for a change. I sold my house and moved to Germany.
>
> Gary was the captain of the team because he **'d played** soccer *since he was five*.

This pattern is also used for **actions** and **events**. We use *had* and the *-en form* to show that something happened before something else in the past. We add time information to show the time between the two actions or events.

|Subject|*have*|*Verb(-en)*|Object|*Time/Time period*|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|**had**|**eaten**||**ten minutes before**.|
|Sally|**had**|**arrived**||**at 8:00**.|
|They|**hadn't**|**taken**|a vacation|**since they were 25**.|

> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/results%20in%20the%20past%2007.png)
>
> Dave offered me a sandwich yesterday but I wasn't hungry because I **'d eaten** *ten minutes before*. 
> - I ate something. Ten minutes after that, Dave offered me a sandwich.
>
> I arrived at 8:30. I thought I was the first one there but Sally **had arrived** *at 8:30*.
> - Sally arrived first.
>
> Sue and Glen took a vacation last week. It had been a long time. They **hadn't taken** a vacation *since they were 25*.
> - Their last vacation was when they were 25.

### Practice
Complete the sentences using *had* and the *-en form*.

1. Everyone got lost except Andrea because she ____ (be) there when she was a child.
2. I was late to work because I ____ (be) stuck in traffic for two hours.
3. When I got home, I realized I ____ (forgot) my bag.
4. After the rain ____ (stop), the children went out to play.
5. She got good grades because she ____ (work) so hard on all her assignments.
6. I tried papaya the other day. I ____ (not have) it before.

### Compare *had + -en form* and the *past form*.
We use *had + -en form* for things that happened **before** something else.
We use the *past form* for things that happened in the **past**. Sometimes either can be used.

> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/results%20in%20the%20past%2008.png)
>
> A: **Had** you ever **eaten** pizza for lunch *before you met me*?
> 
> B: Yes I **had**.
>
> *We are talking about what happened before an event in the past.*

> ![](./static-resource/10.%20Results%20of%20actions%202/results%20in%20the%20past%2009.png)
>
> A: **Did** you ever **eat** pizza for lunch *before you met me*?
>
> B: Yes I **did**.
>
> *We are talking about a time in the past: your life before you met me.*

We use *had + -en form* to make it **clear** that something happened before something else.

We often just use the *past form* and use **common sense** to put things in order.

> I got to work on time but I **had forgotten** to go to the bank.
> - The orders is clear. The plan was: go to the bank before work.
>
> I got to work on time but I **forgot** to go to the bank.
> - Two things that happened in the past: Common sense tells us the order they happened.

*Had + -en form* is sometimes needed because the *past form* suggests that things happened in a different order.

> *When I arrived*, the show **had started**.
> - The show started **before** I arrived. We often say 'the show had already started' to be clearer.
>
> *When I arrived*, the show **started**.
> - We use *when* to say the order things happened. The part with *when* happened first. The other part happened immediately after.
>   - I arrived.
>   - The show started.
>
> He **hadn't lived** in America *when I met him*.
> - **before** I met him
>
> He **didn't** live in America *when I met him*.
> - (**at** the time I met him) He may have lived there before.

### Practice
Complete the narrative with *had + -en form* or the *past form*. There may be more than one answer.

    I ____ (finish) work late and ____ (rush) to the train station, hoping to catch the last train. Luckily, the train ____ (leave). I ____ (put) my hand in my pocket but ____ (can't) find my wallet. I ____ (leave) it in the office. Then I ____ (realize) I ____ (leave) my phone in the office too. This is a real problem, I ____ (do) the same thing the week before too.
