# Constructing basic sentences

SVO word order, place and time

## word order
Different languages arrange their words in different orders. English has a strict word order.

This is the order English uses.

|*Subject*|*Verb*|*Object*|*combine*|
|---|---|---|---|
|I|eat.||I eat.|
|I|work.||I work.|
|We|run.||We run.|
|I|like|chocolate.|I like chocolate.|
|We|hava|breakfast.|We have breakfast.|
|I|play|soccer.|I play soccer.|

### Practice
Put these words in the correct order.

**Example**: drink coffee I  -->  I drink coffee.
- We golf play -->
- fish I eat -->
- like cheese I -->

English uses Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order. 

Here have some different words order used in different languages.
|*Word Order*|*English equivalent*|*Proportion of languages*|*Example languages*|
|---|---|---|---|
|SOV|"She him loves"|45%|Latin, Japanese, Afrikaans|
|**SVO**|**"She loves hime"**|42%|**English**, Mandarin, Russian|
|VSO|"Loves she him"|9%|Biblical Hebrew, Irish|
|VOS|"Loves him she"|3%|Malagasy, Baure|
|OVS|"Him loves she"|1%|Apalai, Hixkarvana|
|OSV|"Him she loves"|<1%|Warao|

## adding a place
As humans, vision is our strongest sense. Our brains are wired to visualize *where* things are.

When speaking English, we visualize where things are in the English way.

We use *at, in* and *on* to say where something is or happens.

![At a point in space. At an event.](./01.%20Constructing%20basic%20sentences/adding%20a%20place%2001.png)

***In*** **a boundary**: Where the area starts and ends IS important.

![In a boundary: where the area starts and ends IS important](./01.%20Constructing%20basic%20sentences/adding%20a%20place%2002.png)

***On*** **a surface:** Where the area starts and ends IS NOT important.

We use *at, in* and *on* to say when something is or happens.

![At a point in time. At an event in time.](./01.%20Constructing%20basic%20sentences/adding%20a%20time%2001.png)

**In：** When the period of time starts and ends IS important.
