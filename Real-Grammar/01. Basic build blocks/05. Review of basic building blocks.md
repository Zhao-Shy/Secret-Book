## review of basic building blocks

### order

English sentences usually have a *subject-verb-object* word order.
|*Subject*|*Verb*|*Object*|
|---|---|---|
|I|eat|fish.|

We use *not* in negative sentences.
|Subject|*do not*|*Verb*|Object
|---|---|---|---|
|I|**don't**|eat|fish.|

We change the order when we make questions. We put verbs like *do* and *be(am, is, are)* first.
|*do*|Subject|*Verb*|Object|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Do**|you|eat|fish?|

We add a place or time to the end of a sentence. We often use *at, in* and *on*.

|---|---|---|---|

|I|eat|fish|at 7PM.|
|I|eat|fish|in the office.|
|I|eat|fish|in summer.|
|I|eat|fish|on a boat.|

When we use ***the***, the listner knows which one or ones.

We use simple words when the listner knows which person or thing we are talking about.

We use similar words to say who or what something belongs to.

![](./05.%20Review%20of%20basic%20building%20blocks/review%20of%20basic%20building%20blocks%2007.png)

We use *one* or *ones* when we don't need to say the noun.

|---|---|
|A: Which apple would you like?|A: Which apples would you like?|
|B: Can I have a big one, please?|B: Can I have two big ones, please?|
