# Ways of talking about the past
past simple, present perfect, *would* and *used to* tense, aspect, modality and quasi-modality for past

## past form
The simplest way to talk about the **past** is to use a verb in the *past form*.

||||
|---|---|---|
|We talk about **periods** of time in the past.|We talk about **actions** and **events** that happened once in the past and are **finished**.|We talk about things that happened many times over a period of time in the past.|
|I **lived** in England *last year*.|She **went** to the park *yesterday*.|She **went** to the park *three times last month.*|

|*This **period** was some time last year. It may be the whole year or part of the year.*|*We are talking about **one time**.*|*We **say** it happened **more than once** and **say when** it happened. If we don't say how many times, we assume it happened once.*|

---

## have + -en form
We use *have + -en form* when we talk about things that happened **before** the present time, and the **result** in the **present** is **important**.

||||
|---|---|---|
|We talk about something that happened before now.|We say we have experienced something **more than once**.|We talk about periods of time that **started in the past** and **include the present**.|
|I **have been** to England.|I **have been** to England **three times**.|She **has been** to the park *three times this year.*|

|*We are talking about the **present**: I have the experience **in the present**.*|*It happened **more than once**. We have experience **in the present**.*|It happened **more than once** over a period of time that includes the **present**.|

## used to and would
We use *uesd to* or *would* to talk about things that happened many times during **periods** of time in the **past**. We don't say how many times. Either can often be used in the same situation.
|||
|---|---|
|She **used to** go to the park.|*When she was a child*, she **would** go to the park after school.|
|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/used%20to%20and%20would%2001.png)|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/used%20to%20and%20would%2002.png)|
|*We don't need to say when.*|*Would refers to options or possbilities at points in time. We add a period of time to show these things happened many times during the period.*|

The difference between *used to* and *would* can be seen in negative sentences.
|||
|---|---|
|I **didn't used to** talk in front of people.|*When I was a child*, I **wouldn't** talk in front of people.|
|*We aren't talking about choice, just what happened.*|*This was an option, I chose not to do this.*|

*Used to* refers to **periods** of time. *Would* refers to options or possibilities at **points** in time.
|||
|---|---|
|We talk about things that were true for a **period** of time in the past.|We use *wouldn't* to talk about **one point** in time in the past. These things were options or possibilities but they didn't happen.|
|I **used to** live in England.|I asked him nicely but he **wouldn't** listen.|
|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/used%20to%20and%20would%2003.png)|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/used%20to%20and%20would%2004.png)|
|*This was true for a period of time in the past.*|*He had the **option** of listening to us but he made the decision **not** to.*|
||We also use *couldn't* in this way.|
||I looked everywhere but I **couldn't** find it.|
||*Finding it was possible but it didn't happen.*|

The meaning of *used* has changed over time. *Used to* + verb and *used* + object are now different words. They are spelled the same but the pronunciation is different.
> I **used to** live in England.
> - The 's' makes a '**s**' sound. The 'd' is lost when it blends with the 't' in *to*.
>
> I **use** a saw to cut the branches.
> - The 's' is voiced and makes a '**z**' sound. The 'd' is pronounced.
