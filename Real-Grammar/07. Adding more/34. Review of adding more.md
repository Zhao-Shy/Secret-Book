## review of adding more

*When, while* and *as* are used in the same way, with different meanings.

We add another subject and verb *(and object etc.)* after a noun to add information about the noun.

We use *who, which, where* and *when* in a similar way.

We add a verb with *to* when both verbs relate to the subject.

We use *to* to say the subject's goal.

When the first verb relates to what the subject does and the second verb relates to what the object does, we add the verb without *to*.

The subject-verb-object order is very common. However we sometimes change the order to emphasize different words. Different orders have different uses.
