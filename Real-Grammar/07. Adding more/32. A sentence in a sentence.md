# A sentence in a sentence
relative clause

## explaining which one
We sometimees add a subject and verb *(and object etc.)* to add information to a noun. We do this if either the speaker or listener doesn't know the name of the person or thing we are talking about or we choose not to use the name. We connect it to what we know.
> The shop *(that) I bought my shoes at* is having a sale.
> - *I bought my shoes at a shop. + That shop is having a sale.*
> - ![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/explaining%20which%20one%2001.png)
> - We use *the* because the listener knows which shop. The added information tells them.

It can be a group of people or things.
> The people **that** *got lost* will be late.
> - Some people got lost. + Those people will be late.
> - ![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/explaining%20which%20one%2002.png)

We always use *that* when the main noun and the subject of the added information are the same.
> The people **that** got lost will be late.
> - If we don't use *that* and say 'The people got lost' we think the sentence ends there. It has a subject, verb and object. 'The people that got lost' is a subject, the listener expects a verb to follow.

|*Subject*||||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|*Main Noun*|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object***|***Place/Time etc.***|||
|The shop|(that)|I|bought|my shoes|at *|is having|a sale.|
|The people|**that**|*|got||lost|will be|late.|
> \* If this subject, verb and object, etc. was a separate sentence the main noun would fit here.

> ![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/explaining%20which%20one%2003.png)
> - We use *this* to talk about something in our current time and place.
>
> ![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/explaining%20which%20one%2004.png)
> - We use *that* to talk about something in another time or place. We use *that* to add needed information about a noun by adding a subject and verb. It is usually obviously at a different time or place so *that* is often optional.

We can talk about **part** of a group of people or things.
> Some people **that** *like music* like singing.
> - Some people like music. + Some of these people like singing.
> - ![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/explaining%20which%20one%2005.png)

> A woman *(that) I work with* rides a motorcycle.
> - I work with some women. + One of these women rides a motorcycle.
> - ![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/explaining%20which%20one%2006.png)
> - We use *a* because I work with more than one woman. I'm not specifically saying which one.

|*Subject*||||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|*Main Noun*|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object***|***Place/Time etc.***|||
|Some people|**that**|*|like|music||like|singing.|
|A woman|(that)|I|work||with *|rides|a motorcycle.|

We can add information to the subject or object the sentence.
|*Subject*||||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|*Main Noun*|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object***|***Place/Time etc.***|||
|The shop|(that)|I|bought|my shoes|at *|is having|a sale.|

### Practice
Make one sentence. There may be more than one answer.

**Example**: I bought my shoes at a shop. The shop is having a sale.
> The shop <u>(that) I bought my shoes at is having a sale.</u>

1. My friend plays the drums. He plays in a band. 
   - My friend ____.
2. This is the ring. I gave it to my wife.
   - This is the ring ____.
3. I was in another country in June. I was in Russia.
   - Russia is the country ____.

## when, where, which, who
![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/when,%20where,%20which,%20who%2001.png)

We can also complete these sentences with *when, where, which* or *who*.
|*Subject*||||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|*Main Noun*|***wh-***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object***|***Place/Time etc.***|||
|The shop|**where**|I|bought|my shoes|*|is having|a sale.|
|The friend|**who<sup>#</sup>**|I|gave|the cake|to *|lives|in that house.|
|A woman|**who**|*|works||in our office|rides|a motorcycle.|
> <sup>#</sup> In formal English we use *whom* instead of *who* when we refer to someone other than the subject.

|Subject|Verb|*Object*||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||*Main Noun*|***wh-***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object***|***Place/Time etc.***|
|1981|was|the year|**when**|I|was born||*.|
|These|are|the shoes|**which**|I|bought|*|yesterday.|
|I|play|a sport|**which**|*|requires|skill.||

*When* and *where* are for times and places. A time or place includes words like *in, on* and *at*.

*That* refers to a thing. It doesn't include *at*, so *at* is often left by itself at the end of the sentence.
> The shop (that) I bought my shoes **at \***.
> - (* = the shoe shop, a thing)
>
> The shop where I bought my shoes *. 
> - (* = at the shoe shop, a place)

This is the same as when we use these words in questions.
> What shop did you buy your shoes **at**?
> - The shoe shop.
>
> Where did you buy your shoes?
> - **At** the shoe shop.

### Practice
Make one sentence without using the name. There may be more than one answer.

**Example**: Which shop is having a sale? The shoe shop. I bought my shoes at the shoe shop.
> - The shop <u>(that) I bought my shoes at</u>.
> - The shop <u>where I bought my shoes</u>.

1. Which park do you want to go to? Nelson Park. We went there last time.
   - The park ________.
2. Which team won? Manchester United. Manchester United wears red.
   - The team ________.
3. Which person got the job? Claire. Claire came to the interview on time.
   - The one ________.

## describing things in two ways
We can put a comma (,), or pause when speaking, and describe something again. The words between the commas provide more information. Our intonation changes when we say the words between the commas. We use a lower pitch to make it clear that this is added information.

We sometimes want to give more information about the subject.
|*Subject*||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.||
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Shoetown,|a shop in the city,|is having|a sale.||
|A friend of mine,|Trevor,|lives|in that house.|![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/describing%20things%20in%20two%20ways%2001.png)|
|Emily,|an office worker,|rides|a motorcycle.||

We sometimes want to give more information about the object.
|Subject|Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|I|was born|in|1981,|a good year.||
|This|is||Angela,|my aunt.|![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/describing%20things%20in%20two%20ways%2002.png)|
|I|play||golf,|a sport.||

We describe a noun with a subject and verb to give more information. *(See page 268.)*
|*Subject*||||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|***2***|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|||
|Shoetown,|the shop|(that)|I|bought|my shoes at *,|is having|a sale.|
|Trevor,|the friend|(that)|I|gave|the cake to *,|lives|in that house.|
|Emily,|a woman|that|*|works|in our office,|rides|a motorcycle.|

The same thing can be said in two sentences.
> Shoetown is having a sale. Shoetown is the shop (that) I bought my shoes at.
>
> Trevor lives in that house. Trevor is the friend (that) I gave the cake to.
>
> Emily rides a motorcycle. Emily is the woman that works in that office.

|Subject|Verb|*Object*||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||1|***2***|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|
|These|are|my new shoes,|shoes|(that)|I|bought|* yesterday.|
|I|play|golf,|a sport|that|*|requires|skill.|
> These are my new shoes. These are the shoes (that) I bought yesterday.
>
> I play golf. Golf is a sport that requires skill.

## simplifying
The listener often knows what we are talking about because we have already said using another word. We often don't say the place, the person etc. (2) when it is obvious.
|*Subject*||||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|2|***wh-***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|||
|Shoetown,|*the place*|where|I|bought|my shoes *,|is having|a sale.|
|Trevor,|*the friend|who|I|gave|the cake to *,|lives|in that house.|
|Emily,|*the woman*|who|*|works|in our office,|rides|a motorcycle.|

|Subject|Verb|*Object*||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||1|2|***wh-***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|
|These|are|my new shoes,|*shoes*|which|I|bought|* yesterday.|
|I|play|golf,|*a sport*|which|*|requires|skill.|

|*Subject*||||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|2|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|||
|Shoetown,|*the place*|that|I|bought|my shoes at *,|is having|a sale.|
|Trevor,|*the friend|that|I|gave|the cake to *,|lives|in that house.|
|Emily,|*the woman*|that|*|works|in our office,|rides|a motorcycle.|

|Subject|Verb|*Object*||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||1|2|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|
|These|are|my new shoes,|*shoes*|that|I|bought|* yesterday.|
|I|play|golf,|*a sport*|that|*|requires|skill.|

> We use *that* in these sentences to make it clear that this is extra information.

### Practice
Make one sentence. The important sentence is in **bold**. The other sentence provides additional information.

**Example**:
> **Trevor lives in that house.** I gave the cake to Trevor.
> - <u>Trevor, (the person) who I gave the cake to, lives in that house.</u>.
> - <u>Trevor, (the person) that I gave the cake to, lives in that house.</u>.
>
> Trevor lives in that house. **I gave the cake to Trevor**.
> - <u>I gave the cake to Trevor, (the person) who lives in that house</u>.

1. **The cheetah is the fastest animal on land.** It can reach speeds of up to 120Km/h.
2. Soda is high in sugar. **Soda is unhealthy.**
3. **My brother lives in Sydney.** He is a dentist.
4. I met Elizabeth this morning. **She likes skiing.**

## -ing and -en
*Be* is the most common verb in English. It often has an important role and tells us if we are talking about the present-future or not. When we add information with the *-ing* or *-en form*, *be* isn't needed, another verb provides the important information so we can leave *be* out.
|*Subject*|||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Main Noun|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|||
|The people|*that*|*|*are* playing|football in the park|look|happy.|
|The employees|*that*|*|*are* chosen|for the new project|will be given|a raise.|
> The people playing football in the park look happy.
> - Some people are playing football in the park. They look happy.
>
> The employees chosen for the new project will be given a raise.
> - Some employees will be chosen for a new project. They will be given a raise.

|Subject|Verb|*Object/Place/Time etc.*|||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||Main Noun|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|
|I|talked|to the man|*that*|*|*was* watering|the garden.|
|These|are|the players|*that*|*|*are* suspended|for 50 games.|
> I talked to the man watering the garden.
> - A man was watering the garden. I talked to him.
>
> These are the players suspended for 50 games.
> - Some players are suspended for 50 games. These are the players.

### Practice
Make one sentence. Make them as simple as possible.

**Example**:
> Some people are playing football in the park. They look happy.
> - <u>The people playing football in the park look happy</u>.

1. A woman is playing the piano. She is very good.
2. Someone will be elected president. This person will have a lot of responsibility.
3. I gave them a letter. The letter was written by my boss.
4. Some of my friends are living in the city. They really enjoy it.

## what
Expressions such as *the thing(s) that...* don't provide much information.

We can use one word (what) to provide the same information. *(what = the thing that)*

We use these sentences to change emphasis.
|*Subject*||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|what|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|||
|What|you|need|*|is|a cold drink.|
|What|I|do|*|helps|people.|
> What you need is a cold drink.
> - *Emphasizing the thing you need.* ≈ You need a cold drink.
>
> What I do helps people.
> - *Emphasizing the thing I do.* ≈ I help people.

We use *when, where, who, why* and *how* in the same way. *(when = the time that, where = the place that, who = the person that, why = the reason that, how = the way that)*
|Subject|Verb|*Object/Place/Time etc.*||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||***wh-***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|
|I|heard|what|he|said|*.|
|I|saw|what|*|made|the noise.|
|I|asked|when|she'll|arrive|*.|
|This|is|where|we|got|married *.|
|She|doesn't know|who|you|like|*.|
|She|knows|who|*|likes|you.|
|I|'d like to know|why|the bus|was|late *.|
|I|'ve forgotten|how|I|did|it *.|
> I heard what he said
> - I heard the thing that he said.
> 
> I saw what made the noise.
> - I saw the thing that made the noise.
>
> I asked when she'll arrive.
> - I asked the time that she'll arrive.
>
> This is where we got married.
> - This is the place that we got married.
>
> She doesn't know who you like.
> - She doesn't know which person you like.
>
> She knows who likes you.
> - She knows which person likes you.
>
> I'd like to know why the bus was late.
> - I'd like to know the reason that the bus was late.
>
> I've forgotten how I did it.
> - I've forgotten the way that I did it.

### Practice
Simplify these sentences using *what, when, where, who, why* or *how*.

**Example**: 
> I heard the thing that he said. 
> - <u>I heard what he said</u>.

1. I remember which person you are.
2. I don't know which place she went.
3. He told me the reason he was late.
4. I remember the time that the rain started.
5. They explained the way that it works.

## polite questions
We use these sentence patterns as questions too. These questions can be about what we know, see, hear, etc.
||Subject|Verb|*Object/Place/Time etc.*||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
||||***wh-***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|
|Did|you|hear|what|he|said|*?|
|Did|you|see|what|*|made|the noise?|
|Does|she|know|who|you|like|*?|
|Does|she|know|who|*|likes|you?|
|Is|this||where|you|got|married?|
|Did|you|ask|when|she'll|arrive|*?|
|Have|you|forgotten|how|you|did|it *?|
|Do|you|know|why|the bus|was|late *?|

We often use this sentence pattern to ask questions. These questions are very useful, starting with expressions like *do you know* or *could you tell me* makes them more polite. We use *if* when there are a limited number of possible answers, for example: yes/no questions.
||Subject|Verb|Recipient|*Object/Place/Time etc.*||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||||***wh- or if***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|
|Do|you|know||what time|the bus|leaves|*?|
|Could|you|tell|me|what|the exchange rate|is|*?|
|Do|you|know||who|*|is selling|the tickets?|
|Could|you|tell|me|where|the restaurant|is|*?|
|Could|you|tell|me|when|they|open|*?|
|Do|you|know||why|the bus|was|late *?|
|Do|you|know||if|there|'s|a toilet near here?|

We can also use *can* instead of *could*, but *could* is more polite. *(See page 114.)*

### Practice
Make these questions polite.

**Example**:
> Where is the restaurant? (could)
> - <u>Could you tell me where the restaurant is</u>?

1. Where does he live? (know)
2. When is the meeting? (know)
3. How old is she? (know)
4. What is the time? (could)
5. Is there an ATM near here? (know)
6. How do you get to the supermarket? (could)
7. Who does that bag belong to? (could)
