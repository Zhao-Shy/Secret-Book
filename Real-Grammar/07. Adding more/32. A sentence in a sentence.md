# A sentence in a sentence
relative clause

## explaining which one
We sometimees add a subject and verb *(and object etc.)* to add information to a noun. We do this if either the speaker or listener doesn't know the name of the person or thing we are talking about or we choose not to use the name. We connect it to what we know.
> The shop *(that) I bought my shoes at* is having a sale.
> - *I bought my shoes at a shop. + That shop is having a sale.*
> - ![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/explaining%20which%20one%2001.png)
> - We use *the* because the listener knows which shop. The added information tells them.

It can be a group of people or things.
> The people **that** *got lost* will be late.
> - Some people got lost. + Those people will be late.
> - ![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/explaining%20which%20one%2002.png)

We always use *that* when the main noun and the subject of the added information are the same.
> The people **that** got lost will be late.
> - If we don't use *that* and say 'The people got lost' we think the sentence ends there. It has a subject, verb and object. 'The people that got lost' is a subject, the listener expects a verb to follow.

|*Subject*||||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|

|*Main Noun*|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object***|***Place/Time etc.***|||
|The shop|(that)|I|bought|my shoes|at *|is having|a sale.|
|The people|**that**|*|got||lost|will be|late.|
> \* If this subject, verb and object, etc. was a separate sentence the main noun would fit here.

> - We use *this* to talk about something in our current time and place.
>
> ![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/explaining%20which%20one%2004.png)
> - We use *that* to talk about something in another time or place. We use *that* to add needed information about a noun by adding a subject and verb. It is usually obviously at a different time or place so *that* is often optional.

We can talk about **part** of a group of people or things.
> Some people **that** *like music* like singing.
> - Some people like music. + Some of these people like singing.

> - We use *a* because I work with more than one woman. I'm not specifically saying which one.

**Example**: I bought my shoes at a shop. The shop is having a sale.
> The shop <u>(that) I bought my shoes at is having a sale.</u>

1. My friend plays the drums. He plays in a band. 
   - My friend ____.

## when, where, which, who
![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/when,%20where,%20which,%20who%2001.png)

We can also complete these sentences with *when, where, which* or *who*.
|*Subject*||||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|*Main Noun*|***wh-***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object***|***Place/Time etc.***|||
|The shop|**where**|I|bought|my shoes|*|is having|a sale.|
|The friend|**who<sup>#</sup>**|I|gave|the cake|to *|lives|in that house.|
|A woman|**who**|*|works||in our office|rides|a motorcycle.|
> <sup>#</sup> In formal English we use *whom* instead of *who* when we refer to someone other than the subject.

|Subject|Verb|*Object*||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||*Main Noun*|***wh-***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object***|***Place/Time etc.***|
|1981|was|the year|**when**|I|was born||*.|
|These|are|the shoes|**which**|I|bought|*|yesterday.|
|I|play|a sport|**which**|*|requires|skill.||

*When* and *where* are for times and places. A time or place includes words like *in, on* and *at*.

*That* refers to a thing. It doesn't include *at*, so *at* is often left by itself at the end of the sentence.
> The shop (that) I bought my shoes **at \***.
> - (* = the shoe shop, a thing)
>
> The shop where I bought my shoes *. 
> - (* = at the shoe shop, a place)

This is the same as when we use these words in questions.
> What shop did you buy your shoes **at**?
> - The shoe shop.
>
> Where did you buy your shoes?
> - **At** the shoe shop.

### Practice
Make one sentence without using the name. There may be more than one answer.

**Example**: Which shop is having a sale? The shoe shop. I bought my shoes at the shoe shop.
> - The shop <u>(that) I bought my shoes at</u>.
> - The shop <u>where I bought my shoes</u>.

1. Which park do you want to go to? Nelson Park. We went there last time.
   - The park ________.
2. Which team won? Manchester United. Manchester United wears red.
   - The team ________.
3. Which person got the job? Claire. Claire came to the interview on time.
   - The one ________.

## describing things in two ways
We can put a comma (,), or pause when speaking, and describe something again. The words between the commas provide more information. Our intonation changes when we say the words between the commas. We use a lower pitch to make it clear that this is added information.

We sometimes want to give more information about the subject.
|*Subject*||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.||
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Shoetown,|a shop in the city,|is having|a sale.||
|A friend of mine,|Trevor,|lives|in that house.|![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/describing%20things%20in%20two%20ways%2001.png)|
|Emily,|an office worker,|rides|a motorcycle.||

We sometimes want to give more information about the object.
|Subject|Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|I|was born|in|1981,|a good year.||
|This|is||Angela,|my aunt.|![](./32.%20A%20sentence%20in%20a%20sentence/describing%20things%20in%20two%20ways%2002.png)|
|I|play||golf,|a sport.||

We describe a noun with a subject and verb to give more information. *(See page 268.)*
|*Subject*||||||Verb|Object/Place/Time etc.|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|***2***|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|||
|Shoetown,|the shop|(that)|I|bought|my shoes at *,|is having|a sale.|
|Trevor,|the friend|(that)|I|gave|the cake to *,|lives|in that house.|
|Emily,|a woman|that|*|works|in our office,|rides|a motorcycle.|

The same thing can be said in two sentences.
> Shoetown is having a sale. Shoetown is the shop (that) I bought my shoes at.
>
> Trevor lives in that house. Trevor is the friend (that) I gave the cake to.
>
> Emily rides a motorcycle. Emily is the woman that works in that office.

|Subject|Verb|*Object*||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|||1|***2***|***that***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place/Time etc.***|
|These|are|my new shoes,|shoes|(that)|I|bought|* yesterday.|
|I|play|golf,|a sport|that|*|requires|skill.|
> These are my new shoes. These are the shoes (that) I bought yesterday.
>
> I play golf. Golf is a sport that requires skill.
