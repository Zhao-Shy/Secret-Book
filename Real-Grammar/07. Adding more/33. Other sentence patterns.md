bare infinitives and word order

## make it happen
We add verbs to a sentence with *to*. These things happen in **sequence**. *(See page 82.)*

Both verbs relate to the subject. The verb after *to* is the subject's goal.
|*Subject*|*Verb1*|||*Verb2*|Object etc.|Remarks|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
||***Verb***|***Ob.***|***to***|***(goal)***|||
|We|**have**||**to**|**buy**|food.|1. **We** have to. 2. **We** buy food.|
|They|**need**||**to**|**work**|tomorrow.|1. **They** need to. 2. **They** work tomorrow.|
|We|**asked**|**her**|**to**|**come**|early.|1. **We** asked. 2. **Our goal**: she comes early.|
|I|**want**|**you**|**to**|**dance**.||1. **I** want it. 2. **My goal**: you dance.|

![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/make%20it%20happen%2001.png)

We sometimes add verbs to a sentence without *to*. In sentences with *let, make* and *help* the **first** verb refers to what the **subject** does, the second verb refers to the **object**'s does.
|Subject|Verb|*Object*|*Verb*|Object etc.|Remarks|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Examples|help|**me**|understand.||**Examples** help me. **I** understand.|
|I|let|**her**|come|in.|**I** let her. **She** came in.|
|Singing|makes|**us**|feel|good.|**Singing** makes us. **We** feel good.|
|I|made|**him**|do|the dishes.|**I** makde him. **He** does the dishes.|

With *help*, the subject and object often have the same goal, so we can think about it either way; with or without *to*. There isn't really any difference. Either sentence can be used.
> Examples help me understand.
> - **Examples** help me. **I** understand.
>
> Examples help me to understand.
> - **Examples** help me. This is **their goal**; it is why they were made.
>
> I helped him move the sofa.
> - **I** helped him. **He** (and I) did it.
>
> I helped him to move the sofa.
> - **I** helped him. Moving the sofa is **our goal**. He and **I** did it.

*Let* and *allow* are used in similar situations, but are used differently because of their meanings.
> We let her come in.
> - We didn't stop her. **She** did it.
>
> We allowed her **to** come in.
> - We gave her permission to. **Our goal**: control who comes in.
>
> Let me introduce myself.
> - You don't stop me. **I** do it.
>
> Allow me **to** introduce myself.
> - You grant me permission. **Your goal**: control the situation. (formal)

Sentences often start with *let's* meaning *let us*.
> Let's get a coffee.
> - (Let us get a coffee.) May nothing stop us.
>
> Let's move on to the next page.
> - (Let us move on to the next page.) May nothing stop us.

*Make* can be used in lots of situations.

![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/make%20it%20happen%2002.png)

> I'm **making** breakfast tomorrow.
>
> He **made** a donation.
>
> She likes **making** new friends.
>
> We **made** a reservation.
>
> They **make** the bed every morning.
> - The bed is not as they want it. They make it. It is how they want it.

*Make* is a simple verb that can be used instead of : *construct, create, manufacture, prepare, produce, arrange, invent* etc.

We also use *make it* when we successfully go somewhere but we don't have much **time** or **energy**.
> The bus is late but you can still **make it** to school on time.
> - There isn't much time.
>
> They paddled really hard and just **made it** across the river.
> - They didn't have much more energy.

We also use *make* with an object and and another verb (as on the previous page). The second verb refers to what the object does.

![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/make%20it%20happen%2003.png)

> Singing **makes** me feel good.
>
> She **made** the TV work.
>
> The machine is **making** the table shake.
>
> Gas **makes** the car go.
>
> I'll **make** him do the dishes.

When we use *was made (be + -en form)*, the subject does the action, so we use *to*.
> He was made *to* do the dishes.
> - **He** was made to. **He** did the dishes.

We also use *to* with *ask* and *tell*. We focus on what the subject says. We don't know if the person does the action or not.
> I'll ask them **to** open the window.
> - They may or may not open it. It's their decision.
>
> I told her **to** come in.
> - She may or may not have come in.

### Practice
Complete the sentences with *to* where needed. Leave other spaces blank. There may be more than one answer.
1. He asked me ____ buy milk.
2. He was made ____ feel like he didn't matter.
3. I helped them ____ clean the house.
4. My boss makes me ____ work overtime.
5. I told her ____ be here on time.
6. Let's ____ go home.

## get it done
We use *have* to refer to a part of something, or **something additional**.

![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/get%20it%20done%2001.png)

We also use *have* when **someone additional** does something.

The subject **arranges** the object to do something.
|Subject|Verb|*Object*|*Verb*|Object etc.|Remarks|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|She|had|him|**take**|her photo.|**She** arranged it. **He** took her photo.|
|He|has|someone|**cut**|his hari.|**He** arranged it. **Someone** cuts his hair.|

We often don't say who did it. We simply say what happens to the object, **affecting** the subject.
|Subject|Verb|*Object*|*Verb*|Object etc.|Remarks|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|She|had|her photo|**taken**.||**She** was affected. **Her photo** was taken.|
|He|has|his hari|**cut**.||**He** is affected. **His hair** is cut.|

![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/get%20it%20done%2002.png)

We use *get* when things change. (We don't have someone do it, then we have someone do it.)

We say what causes this change. (The subject **causes** someone to do something.)
|*Subject*|*Verb*|Object|*to*|*Verb*|Object etc.|Remarks|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|She|got|him|**to**|**take**|her photo.|**She** caused it. **Her goal**: photo. He did it.
|He|gets|someone|**to**|**cut**|his hair.|**He** causes it. **His goal**: cut hair.|

![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/get%20it%20done%2003.png)

We often don't say who did it. We simply say what happens to the object, **caused** by the subject.
|*Subject*|*Verb*|Object|*Verb*|Object etc.|Remarks|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|She|got|her photo|**taken**.||**She** caused it. **Her goal**: photo.|
|He|gets|his hair|**cut**.||**He** causes it. **His goal**: cut hair.|

We can often use *have* or *get* in the same situations. With *get* the subject causes the action.

*Have* is less direct and therefore more formal. With *have* the subject may not actually do anything.
> She **had** her photo taken.
> - She may or may not have asked someone. (formal/informal)
> 
> She **got** her photo taken.
> - She asked someone to do it. (informal)

In some situations *have* and *get* have different meanings.
> She **had** her bike stolen.
> - She did not ask for this to happen. It **affected** her.
>
> She **got** her bike stolen.
> - She did something that **caused** it. She should have been more careful.
>
> His boss **had** him promoted.
> - His supervisor **arranged** it. *Got* also fits: the boss caused it.
>
> His exceptional work on the project **got** him promoted.
> - His exceptional work **caused** it.

---

## experience it
When we say what we see, hear, feel etc. we don't use *to* before the second verb.

The **first** verb refers to what the **subject** does, the second verb refers to what the **object** does.
|S.|Verb|*Object*|*Verb*|Object etc.|Remarks|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|We|saw|your mom|**rescue**|a dog.|**We** saw your mom. **She** rescued a dog.|
|I|'m watching|the rain|**come**|down.|**I**'m watching the rain. **It** is coming down.|
|You|will hear|someone|**knock**|at the door.|**You** will hear someone. **They** will knock.|

We can also use the *-ing form* in these situations to emphasize something happening.
> We saw your mom **rescuing** a dog.
> - **We** saw your mom. **She** was rescuing a dog (not finished).

### Why do we say *look **at*** and *listen **to***?
As we can see above, *see, watch* and *hear* are followed by an object. We say **what we experience**.

*Look* and *listen* aren't followed by an object. When we are awake, we are always looking and listening. It is **what we do**.
|||
|-|-|
|We look **at** things. Our eyes move around and we focus on one thing at a time. We can only see what we are looking at.|We listen **to** things. There are many sounds around us all the time. The thing we listen to is the thing we give our attention to.|
|![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/experience%20it%2001.png)|![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/experience%20it%2002.png)|
|![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/experience%20it%2003.png)|![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/experience%20it%2004.png)|
|*He can only see what he is looking at. He can't see what is behind him.*|*I can hear a dog, someone talking and someone working; but I'm not listening to those things.*|

We may add a verb after the place or destination. This refers to what the **place** or **destination** does.
> Look at her **go**!
> - I look at her. She goes. *(fast!)*
>
> We listened to him **talk** about his time abroad.
> - We listened to him. He talked.

### Practice
Complete the sentences with *to* or *at* where needed. Leave other spaces blank.
1. I look ____ the tide times before I go ____ fishing.
2. I listen ____ the news ____ keep up to date with current events.
3. I watched ____ my daughter ____ open her birthday presents.
4. I watched ____ a documentary ____ learn about history.
5. I heard ____ you ____ got a new car.
6. Look ____ him ____ dance!
7. I saw ____ her ____ give him a present.

## here you are
We move *here* and *there* to the start of the sentence to focus on **where**.

![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/here%20you%20are%2001.png)

Some expressions are better in some situations depending on what we are focusing on.

|||
|-|-|
|![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/here%20you%20are%2002.png)|![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/here%20you%20are%2002.png)|
|Has my package arrived yet?|Could you help me look for my pen?|
|Yes, **it**'s here.|Yes... **here** it is!|
|*Emphasis on **it** (the package). We want to know about the package, is it here or not?*|*Emphasis on **here**. We want to know **where**. Where is it?*|

When we give something to someone, we talk about what **is here**.
||||
|-|-|-|
|The thing we are giving is here. We can say '**Here** it **is**' referring to the thing we are giving.|The person receiving the object is also **here**. It is more polite to refer to the person, so we usually say '**Here** you **are**'.|Sometimes the thing we are giving is important. The end of a sentence is also a strong position so we put it there.|
|![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/here%20you%20are%2004.png)|![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/here%20you%20are%2005.png)|![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/here%20you%20are%2006.png)|
> We also use the expressions 'there you are' or 'here you go' etc. in these situations.

We also put important information last for emphasis.
|||
|-|-|
|![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/here%20you%20are%2007.png)|![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/here%20you%20are%2008.png)|
|Could you help me look for my pen?|Could you help me look for my pen?|
|Yes... **here** it **is**!|Yes... **here** is **your pencil**...|
|***It** is not important because we already know what it refers to (the pen). **Is** is more important.*|***Your pencil** is important because it is new information.*|

---

## here comes the end
We also focus on **where** when we talk about things coming and going.

![](./33.%20Other%20sentence%20patterns/here%20comes%20the%20end%2001.png)

|*Subject*|Verb|*Place*|
|-|-|-|
|**It**|goes|**there**.|
|**The bus**|goes|**to the museum**.|
> I want to go to the museum.
>
> Take this bus. **It** goes **there**.
>
> **What** it is and **where** generally it goes.

|*Place*|Subject|*Verb*|
|-|-|-|
|**There**|it|**goes**.|
> Does the 112 stop here?
>
> Yes... **there** it **goes**. You've just missed it!
>
> **Where** it is and **movement**.

These sentences are also useful in this situation.
|*Place*|Verb|*Person/Thing*|
|-|-|-|
|**There**|goes|**the bus**.|
> Hurry up, we're late!
>
> Oh no, **there** goes **the bus**!
>
> **Where** it is and **what** it is.

|*Subject*|*Verb*|
|-|-|
|**The bus**|is **leaving**.|
> Let's go. **The bus** is **leaving** soon.
>
> **What** it is and what it is **doing**.

We also use other words to say where.
|*Place*|Subject|*Verb*|
|-|-|-|
|**There**|it|**goes**.|
|**Up**|you|**come**.|
|**In**|she|**comes**.|
|**Off**|you|**go**.|
