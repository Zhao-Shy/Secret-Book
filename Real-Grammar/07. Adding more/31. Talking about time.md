# Talking about time
adverbial clauses

## when
We add information with *when* to give details about the **point in time** we are referring to. 

These details are based on the time of something else.

We use *when* to describe something that happens immediately after something else.

We talk about a time in the **past** or **future**.

> <u>I'll be waiting at the station when you arrive.</u>

1. I lived in London in 2001. I was 23 in 2001. ________

## while
We use *while* for actions or events that happen between the **start** and **end** of something else.
|||
|-|-|
|I fixed the computer **while** *you worked*.|I'll fix the computer **while** *you work*.|
|![](./31.%20Talking%20about%20time/while%2001.png)|![](./31.%20Talking%20about%20time/while%2002.png)|

|Subject|Verb|Object etc.|*Time*||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
||||***while***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place etc.***|
|I|carried|her bag|**while**|she|talked|on the phone.|
|He|listened|to music|**while**|he|waited|for the bus.|
|You|'ll arrive||**while**|I|'m|at work.|
|You|'re going to be|here|**while**|we|'re|in Africa.|

We can use *be* and the *-ing form* in either part or both parts if we like.

We use the *-ing form* to emphasize actions happening.
> I was fixing the computer **while** *you were working*.
>
> I'll be fixing the computer **while** *you're working*.
>
> ![](./31.%20Talking%20about%20time/while%2003.png)

> I was fixing the computer **while** *you worked*.
>
> I'll be fixing the computer **while** *you work*.
>
> ![](./31.%20Talking%20about%20time/while%2004.png)

> I fixed the computer **while** *you were working*.
>
> I'll fix the computer **while** *you're working*.
>
> ![](./31.%20Talking%20about%20time/while%2005.png)

In some situations, either *while* or *when* can be used. The meaning is essentially the same. This happens when we make it clear the action is not finished at the time by using *-ing*.
> I saw her **while** she was talking on the phone.
> - While: between the start and end of the activity.
>
> I saw her **when** she was talking on the phone.
> - When: I saw her. I say what she was doing at that point in time.

||||***while***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place etc.***|
|He|heard|the news|**while**|*he*|*was* waiting|for the bus.|
> He heard the news while waiting for the bus.

*While* and *when* often give sentences different meanings.
> I'll clean the table **while** you wash the dishes.
> - **While**: between the start and end - I'll clean the table, at the time you'll be washing the dishes.
>
> I'll clean the table **when** you wash the dishes.
> - **When**: immediately after - I'm waiting for you to start washing the dishes, then I'll clean the table.

### Practice
Make one sentence using *when* or *while*. You don't need to say the actual times. There may be more than one answer.

**Example**: She talked on her phone. During that time I carried her bag.
> <u>I carried her bag while she talked on her phone.</u>

1. I waited to see the doctor. During that time I read a magazine. ________
2. We made a lot of friends last week. We were on holiday last week. ________
3. I liked video games in 2001. I was a child in 2001. ________

---

## as
We use *as* when something happens **at the same time** something else happens.
> I got to the bus stop **as** *the bus was leaving*.
>
> ![](./31.%20Talking%20about%20time/as%2001.png)

|Subject|Verb|Object etc.|*Time*||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
||||***as***|***Subject***|***Verb***|***Object/Place etc.***|
|She|said|"hello"|**as**|she|entered|the room.|
|He|farted||**as**|he|stood up.||
|People|get|wiser|**as**|they|get|older.|
|The cost|will go|up|**as**|sales|increase.||

The longer action comes after *as*.
We are specifying the time. The action happens at the time of the longer action or event.

*As* and *while* have different meanings.
|||
|-|-|
|Take each day **as** *it comes*.|Get it **while** it's hot!|
|![](31.%20Talking%20about%20time/as%2002.png)|![](31.%20Talking%20about%20time/as%2003.png)|
|*The day comes, you take it **at that time**.*|*It will be hot for **a period of time**. After that period it will be considered warm, cool, then cold.*|

Sometimes either *as* or *while* can fit the same situation.
|||
|-|-|
|We danced **as** *the band played*.|We danced **while** *the band played*.|
|![](31.%20Talking%20about%20time/as%2004.png)|![](31.%20Talking%20about%20time/as%2005.png)|
|*We daced and the band played **at the same time**.|We danced for **a period of time**, between the start and end of the band's performance.|

### Practice
Make one sentence using *as*. These things happened at the same time.

**Example**: She entered the room. At that time she said "hello".
> <u>She said "hello" as she entered the room.</u>

1. I left work at 5:37 yesterday. I saw Joe at 5:37 yesterday. ________
2. Sea levels will rise. Islands will go underwater. ________
3. Take the clothes off the washing line. Put them in the basket at that time. ________
