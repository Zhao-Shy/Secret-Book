# Ways of talking about the past
past simple, present perfect, *would* and *used to* tense, aspect, modality and quasi-modality for past

## past form
The simplest way to talk about the **past** is to use a verb in the *past form*.

||||
|---|---|---|
|We talk about **periods** of time in the past.|We talk about **actions** and **events** that happened once in the past and are **finished**.|We talk about things that happened many times over a period of time in the past.|
|I **lived** in England *last year*.|She **went** to the park *yesterday*.|She **went** to the park *three times last month.*|
|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/past%20form%2001.png)|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/past%20form%2002.png)|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/past%20form%2003.png)|
|*This **period** was some time last year. It may be the whole year or part of the year.*|*We are talking about **one time**.*|*We **say** it happened **more than once** and **say when** it happened. If we don't say how many times, we assume it happened once.*|

---

## have + -en form
We use *have + -en form* when we talk about things that happened **before** the present time, and the **result** in the **present** is **important**.

||||
|---|---|---|
|We talk about something that happened before now.|We say we have experienced something **more than once**.|We talk about periods of time that **started in the past** and **include the present**.|
|I **have been** to England.|I **have been** to England **three times**.|She **has been** to the park *three times this year.*|
|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/have%20+%20-en%20form%2001.png)|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/have%20+%20-en%20form%2002.png)|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/have%20+%20-en%20form%2003.png)|
|*We are talking about the **present**: I have the experience **in the present**.*|*It happened **more than once**. We have experience **in the present**.*|It happened **more than once** over a period of time that includes the **present**.|

---

## used to and would
We use *uesd to* or *would* to talk about things that happened many times during **periods** of time in the **past**. We don't say how many times. Either can often be used in the same situation.
|||
|---|---|
|She **used to** go to the park.|*When she was a child*, she **would** go to the park after school.|
|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/used%20to%20and%20would%2001.png)|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/used%20to%20and%20would%2002.png)|
|*We don't need to say when.*|*Would refers to options or possbilities at points in time. We add a period of time to show these things happened many times during the period.*|

The difference between *used to* and *would* can be seen in negative sentences.
|||
|---|---|
|I **didn't used to** talk in front of people.|*When I was a child*, I **wouldn't** talk in front of people.|
|*We aren't talking about choice, just what happened.*|*This was an option, I chose not to do this.*|

*Used to* refers to **periods** of time. *Would* refers to options or possibilities at **points** in time.
|||
|---|---|
|We talk about things that were true for a **period** of time in the past.|We use *wouldn't* to talk about **one point** in time in the past. These things were options or possibilities but they didn't happen.|
|I **used to** live in England.|I asked him nicely but he **wouldn't** listen.|
|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/used%20to%20and%20would%2003.png)|![](./static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/used%20to%20and%20would%2004.png)|
|*This was true for a period of time in the past.*|*He had the **option** of listening to us but he made the decision **not** to.*|
||We also use *couldn't* in this way.|
||I looked everywhere but I **couldn't** find it.|
||*Finding it was possible but it didn't happen.*|

The meaning of *used* has changed over time. *Used to* + verb and *used* + object are now different words. They are spelled the same but the pronunciation is different.
> I **used to** live in England.
> - The 's' makes a '**s**' sound. The 'd' is lost when it blends with the 't' in *to*.
>
> I **use** a saw to cut the branches.
> - The 's' is voiced and makes a '**z**' sound. The 'd' is pronounced.

## which one should I use?
There isn't one correct answer for every situdation. The sentences we use depend on how we are thinking about the past. Here are some different ways we think and talk about the past.

We often don't say when something happened in the past. We use either the *past form* or *have + -en form*.
|I'm sorry I'm late...||
|---|---|
|![](../static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/which%20one%20should%20I%20use%2001.png)|![](../static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/which%20one%20should%20I%20use%2002.png)|
|*We know when it happened because of the context.*|*It is clear that we are talking about something that happened in the past with a result in the present.*|

In some situations we can use *didn't (past form)* or add *wouldn't* or *couldn't*.
|||
|---|---|
|The car **didn't** start so I took the bus.|The car **wouldn't** start so I took the bus.|
|*It simply didn't happen.*|*I tried, but it wasn't possible for the car to start. We also use couldn't: 'I couldn't get the car started so I took the bus.'*|

When we talk about things that were true for a period in the past we can use *the past form* or *used (to)*. When we use *the past form* the listener wants to know **when**. It is often not true in the present.

|I'm going to Canada next week.||
|---|---|
|![](../static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/which%20one%20should%20I%20use%2003.png)|![](../static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/which%20one%20should%20I%20use%2004.png)|
|*This was true for a period of time in the past. I don't live in Canada now.*|*This was true for a period of time in the past. I don't live in Canada now.*|

However, it may be true in the present too.
|||
|---|---|
|I haven't been to this part of town for ages.|~|
|*Last time I was here*, there **was** a good cafe on this street.|There **used to** be a good cafe on this street.|
|I hope it's still there.|~|
|*Later...*|~|
|Yes! It's still here!|~|

When we talk about things that happened many times over a period of time in the past, we can use the *past form, would* or *used to*. When we use the *past form* or *would* the listener wants to know **when**. It often doesn't happen in the present.

|Do you play sport? No, but...|||
|---|---|---|
|![](../static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/which%20one%20should%20I%20use%2005.png)|![](../static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/which%20one%20should%20I%20use%2006.png)|![](../static-resource/19.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20past/which%20one%20should%20I%20use%2007.png)|
|*What happened in the past. We say when: many times during a period of time.*|*We can add the time to add more information:* when I was a teenager, I **used to** play sport.|*There were options and this is what I chose to do. We say when so we know we are talking about past, not a hypothetical situation.*|

However, it may happen in the present too.
||||
|---|---|---|
|*When she was a child* she **talked** like an adult.|*When she was a child* she **used to** talk like an adult.|*When she was a child* she would talk like an adult.|
> She **is** an adult now, it is very likely that she **still** talks like one.

We often start with *used to* (we don't need to say when) and then use the *past form* or *would* to add further information. We can use *used to* again but we usually use one of the other expressions because they are shorter and simpler.
> In the summer **we used** to go to the coast...
> - (a) There was a river and we **'d** spend our days fishing. *(would: remembering)*
> - (b) There was a river and we **spent** our days fishing. *(past form: at these times in the past.)*
> - (c) There was a river and we **used to** spend our days fishing. *(used to: during a period in the past.)*

## used to / be used to
We talk about things we *used to* do and things we *are used to* doing. Words change meanings over time. These two expressions include the same word (*used*) but they have very different meanings.
||||
|---|---|---|
||*used to*: a during a period of time in the past. *(used to + verb)*|*be uesd to*: comfortable with something (generally speakinig). *(be used to + noun)*|
||Greg **used to** work late.|Greg **is used to** working late.|
