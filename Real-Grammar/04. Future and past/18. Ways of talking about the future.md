# Ways of talking about the future
present simple, present progressive, *will* and *be going to* tense, aspect, modality and quasi-modality for future

## am/is/are + -ing form  *<sub>(See page 58.)</sub>*
We often talk about the future using *be (am/is/are)* and the *-ing form* to talk about something that is **not finished** *(and has **not started** yet)*. This is a very simple way to talk about the future and can be used in many situations. We are talking about what is happening **after** the present time.

> She **'s leaving** *at 6:30*.
>
> We **'re having** a BBQ *on Sunday*.
>
> **Is** he **working** *on Saturday*?
>
> *When* **are** we **going** home?
>
> I **'m not doing** yoga *on Monday*.
>
> We **aren't going out** *tonight*.

---

## present form *<sub>(See page 52.)</sub>*
We also talk about the future using a verb in the *present form*. We speak generally about things that just happen. These things are **fixed**, such as things that happen according to **schedule**.

> The bus **leaves** *at 6:30*.
>
> The meeting **is** *at 10*.
>
> **Does** he work *on Saturday*?
>
> *When* **is** the party?
>
> The concert **doesn't** start *at 6*.
>
> They **don't** arrive *at 5:20*.

### Practice

## will and be going to
We use *will* when we think about possibilities and make a prediction, and when we think about options and make a decision. *(See page 118.)*

We often make a decision to go somewhere. Then we go there, moving through space.

![](../18.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20future/will%20and%20be%20going%20to%2001.png)

We talk about time the same way we talk about space. We make a decision to do something. Then we move through time until it happens in the future.

![](../18.%20Ways%20of%20talking%20about%20the%20future/will%20and%20be%20going%20to%2002.png)

I *'m going to* (= not finished now) *do* something (= next step).

The next step is sometime in the future. We don't need to say when it is going to happen.

|Subject|*be going to*|*Verb*|Object|Time|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|She|**is going to**|wait.|||She's going to wait.|
|I|**am going to**|watch|TV|all day.|I'm going to watch TV all day.|
|He|**isn't going to**|drink|coffee|today.|He isn't going to drink coffee today.|

We can also use *be (am, is, are) + going to* for predictions based on clear evidence.

These things are controlled by laws of the universe. There are no other possibilities.
> He **'s going to** fall off!
>
> She doesn't have an umbrella. She **'s going to** get wet.

    When people use 'be going to' the words 'going to' sometimes get blended together into 'gonna'.
