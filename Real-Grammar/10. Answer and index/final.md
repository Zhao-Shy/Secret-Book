# final thoughts
We all learn by understanding core concepts and connecting new information to what we know. This book explains connections I have found while exploring English to find what different parts of the language mean and how they work together. Language are ever-changing systems and there is always more to be discovered. This book was written to help others discover basic truths of English and the beauty of how languages combine simple components to achieve so much.

The English language is constantly changing and evolving. This book shows how international English works based on the experiences of a 35 year old Australian in 2016 who has spent many years abroad interacting with a variety of English speakers from different backgrounds. We all have different experiences with our language and there will be some differences in how people use English, largely due to their age and where they are from. This book aims to address the core concepts of the language that we all share in common.

I wrote this book to move away from the rules and exceptions that are currently used to teach grammar. I see no evidence of exceptions within a language. Everything happens for a reason. In my view, if there is an exception to a rule, the rule simply doesn't fit and should be refined or discarded. While researching for this book I have reworked and dismissed many rules and explanations that work most of the time but don't fit every situation. This has pushed me to go deeper or find the core meanings that always hold true.

The explanations in this book are based on my experiences interacting in English and in-depth grammar research to make sure my explanations fit with all uses of each word or structure. However, learning is an ongoing process. I have learned a lot while researching for this book but I am continuing to find out new interesting things about the language and how it is used all the time.

This book was written to provide you with the initial framework you need to get started. I hope that by reading this book, you have a deeper understanding of how the English language really works.

I wish you all the best with your studies.
