|This **started** in the **past** and **finishes** in the **future**. It is happening **now**.|This **starts** and **finishes** in the **future**. It is happening in the **future**.|
|We also talk about things that started in the past and finish in the future that are not happening right now.|Sometimes exactly when doesn't matter. We know it is in the near future.|
|I **'m learning** Spanish. *(We know that it isn't happening right now. I'm speaking English now.)*|I **'m getting** a new bike! *(This is in the future. We know that it isn't happening in the present.)*|
