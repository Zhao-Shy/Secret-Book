## -ing form: as a subject
When we use the *-ing form* we are talking about something happening. We can use it as a noun.

![](./static-resource/08.%20Unfinished%20actions/-ing%20form%20as%20a%20subject%2001.png)

When we talk about an activity, we talk about the activity happening, not the activity being complete.

We can use the activity as as a subject.

|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Hiking**|is||fun.|Hiking is fun.|
|**Drawing**|requires|skill.||Drawing requires skill.|

> Hiking is fun: The fun part is doing the activity, not the fact that it finishes.

The *-ing form* is used in the same way as other subjects for questions and negatives too.

|Does|**drawing**|require|skill?||Does drawing require skill?|
||**Hiking**|isn't||fun.|Hiking isn't fun.|
||**Drawing**|doesn't require|skill.||Drawing doesn't require skill.|
