## things we sometimes don't count
There are some things we easily count. We use *a* or *an* or add an *s*.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/things%20we%20sometimes%20don't%20count%2001.png)


However, we can't always count apple. Once it is cut it is hard to imagine how many apples. We simply say it is apple *(without an or s)*. If we want to count it we can easily count the slices.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/things%20we%20sometimes%20don't%20count%2002.png)

There are some things we usually can't count. When we imagine wine there are many things wo can imagine. Wine comes in many sizes so we can't usually count it. We say generally what it is.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/things%20we%20sometimes%20don't%20count%2003.png)

*We count glasses, bottles or barrels.*

However, in some situations wo can count wine.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/things%20we%20sometimes%20don't%20count%2004.png)

We can count it. We know they want **one glass** of red wine because of the situation.

We can count wines. These are **two kinds** we can choose from.

We count things when we imagine one or more of the thing we are talking about. We don't count things when we imagine parts of something.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/things%20we%20sometimes%20don't%20count%2005.png)

There are some things we use to talk about groups of things.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/things%20we%20don't%20count%2001.png)


*The word **furniture** talks about these things generally belonging to the same group.*

When we want to count these things, we say: a piece of furniture, two pieces of furniture. We can also count them as separate items: a sofa, two tables.

There are some things we can't see or hear. We think of them as complex things that are made up of many small parts, so wo talk about them generally too.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/things%20we%20don't%20count%2002.png)

Some things come in pairs. We count them as pairs.

## some and any
We use ***some*** and ***any*** when the amount is not important. It may be something we can or can't count.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/some%20and%20any%2001.png)

We use ***any*** in questions and negative sentences.

|I have **some** apples. *(more than one apple)*| She has **some** bread. *(a slice or a loaf etc.)*|
|I **don't** have **any** apples. *(zero apples)*|She doesn't have **any** bread. *(none)*|
|Do you have **any** apples? *(zero or some?)*|Does she have **any** bread? *(none or some?)*|

## here and there
We use ***here*** to refer to where we are. We use ***there*** to refer to somewhere else. The person we are talking to knows the place we are talking about.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/here%20and%20there%2001.png)

We often start sentences whit ***there is*** or ***there are*** and say where it is later in the sentence.

|||
|---|---|
|***There's*** a spoon **in the drawer**|***There're*** some trees **in the park**.|
|***There isn't*** restaurant **in the hotel**.|***There aren't*** any snakes **in my yard**.|
|***Is there*** an ATM **near here**?|***Are there*** any ATMs **near here**?|

We also use ***there is*** or ***there are*** to simply say things exist. Exactly where is not important.

|||
|---|---|
|***There's*** a solution.|***There're*** some things to talk about.|
|***There isn't*** a problem.|***There aren't*** any stupid questions.|

## the
When we use ***the*** the listner knows which person or thing we are referring to.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/the%2001.png)

We use ***the*** for things that are common knowledge. (Everybody knows which apple is big.)

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/the%2002.png)

We also use ***the*** for more than one person or thing.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/the%2003.png)

We use ***the*** when the listner knows which one we are talking about.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/the%2004.png)

The listner often knows which person or thing we are referring to because we are talked about it before.

![](./static-resource/04.%20One%20or%20more/the%2005.png)

|||
|---|---|
|***a band*** - we don't know which band.|***The Australian*** - the one in the band.|
|***an American*** - we don't know which American.|***The dums*** - one of many instruments - we know which one.
|***An Australian*** - we don't know which Australian.||

We don't use ***a*** or ***the*** with names, such as names of people or names of sports.

    I play tennis. (Tennis is the name of the sport.)
    I play the guitar. (We use 'the' because the listner knows which instrument I am talking about.)

We often use ***the*** when we are talking about places. The listner knows what kind of place it is, but which one doesn't matter.

We use ***a*** when the listner doesn't know which one. They often ask in these situations.

|Subject|Verb|*Place*|
|---|---|---|
|I|am|**at the bank.**|
|She|is|**at the supermarket.**|
|We|are|**at the beach.**|

*Which bank is not important. The speaker wants them to picture a standard bank.*

|Subject|Verb|*Place/Event*|
