## introduction to verb forms

Different verb forms are used to give different information about time.

The following this sections explore these verb forms and their uses.

The first verb of the sentences gives us **basic information** about the time we are referring to.

The first verb is either in the *present form* or *past form*.

We will look at these **two** forms in more detail in this section.

|present form|past form|
|---|---|
|be/am/is/are|was/were|
|have/has|had|
|go/goes|went|
|get/gets|got|
|say/says|said|
|do/does|did|
|make/makes|made|
|know/knows|knew|
|think/thinks|thought|
|take/takes|took|
|see/sees|saw|
|want/wants|wanted|
|look/looks|looked|
|use/uses|used|
|find/finds|found|
|give/gives|gave|
|We add the *s* when the subject is a *he, she* or *it*. The meaning of the verb is the same, but the subject is different.|Some common verbs have *past form* that are different to the *present form*. With most verbs, we use the *present form* **+** *-ed*.|
|I **eat** breakfast. / He **eats** breakfast.|I **ate** breakfast this morning.|
|I **live** in England. / She **lives** in England.|She **lived** in England last year.|

We use the *-ing form* or *-en form* to add **extra information**.

|-ing form|-en form|
|---|---|
|being|been|
|having|had|
|going|gone|
|getting|gotten|
|saying|said|
|doing|done|
|making|made|
|knowing|known|
|thinking|thought|
|taking|taken|
|seeing|seen|
|wanting|wanted|
|looking|looked|
|using|used|
|finding|found|
|giving|given|
|All *-ing form* end in *-ing*.|Some verbs have a separate form often ending in *-en, -ne* or *n*. However, most verbs use the same form as the *past form*.|
|I'm eating breakfast. *(now)*|I've eaten breakfast.|
|She's living in England. *(now)*|She's lived in England.|
