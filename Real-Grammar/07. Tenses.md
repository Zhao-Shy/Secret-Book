## introduction to verb forms

Different verb forms are used to give different information about time.

The following this sections explore these verb forms and their uses.

The first verb of the sentences gives us **basic information** about the time we are referring to.

The first verb is either in the *present form* or *past form*.

We will look at these **two** forms in more detail in this section.

|present form|past form|
|---|---|
|be/am/is/are|was/were|
|have/has|had|
|go/goes|went|
|get/gets|got|
|say/says|said|
|do/does|did|
|make/makes|made|
|know/knows|knew|
|think/thinks|thought|
|take/takes|took|
|see/sees|saw|
|want/wants|wanted|
|look/looks|looked|
|use/uses|used|
|find/finds|found|
|give/gives|gave|
|We add the *s* when the subject is a *he, she* or *it*. The meaning of the verb is the same, but the subject is different.|Some common verbs have *past form* that are different to the *present form*. With most verbs, we use the *present form* **+** *-ed*.|
|I **eat** breakfast. / He **eats** breakfast.|I **ate** breakfast this morning.|
|I **live** in England. / She **lives** in England.|She **lived** in England last year.|

We use the *-ing form* or *-en form* to add **extra information**.

|-ing form|-en form|
|---|---|
|being|been|
|having|had|
|going|gone|
|getting|gotten|
|saying|said|
|doing|done|
|making|made|
|knowing|known|
|thinking|thought|
|taking|taken|
|seeing|seen|
|wanting|wanted|
|looking|looked|
|using|used|
|finding|found|
|giving|given|
|All *-ing form* end in *-ing*.|Some verbs have a separate form often ending in *-en, -ne* or *n*. However, most verbs use the same form as the *past form*.|
|I'm eating breakfast. *(now)*|I've eaten breakfast.|
|She's living in England. *(now)*|She's lived in England.|

## present form
The verbs in the sentences we have looked at so far have been in the *present form*.

### What is it?
|*present form*|past form|ing form|en form|
|---|---|---|---|
|*eat*|ate|eating|eaten|
|*work*|worked|working|worked|
|*have*|had|having|had|
|*play*|played|playing|played|

### What does it mean?
We talk about things that are generally true. Things that are generally true are true in the **present-future**. They may be true in the past too.

### How do we use it?

|||
|---|---|
|We use the *present form* to talk about things that happen **many times**.|We use the *present form* to talk about things that are generally **permanent**.|
|![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2002.png)|![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2003.png)|

|Subject|*Verb*|Object|Place/Time|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|**eat**||at work.|We eat at work.|
|She|**works**||on Wednesdays.|She workd on Wednesdays.|
|They|**live**||in Sweden.|They live in Sweden.|
|You|**like**|swimming.||You like swimming.|
|He|**has**|breakfast|at 7:30|He has breakfast at 7:30.|
|I|**play**|soccer|on Sundays.|I play soccer on Sundays.|

We talk about things that are always true. These are **facts**.

![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2004.png)

We talk about things that are true now. These are **descriptions**. *(We describe things in the present.)*

![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2005.png)

Things may be generally true because they are fixed, and can't be changed or controlled. These are **scheduled events**. We often add a **future time** to make this clear.

![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2006.png)

We talk about quick actions or events that finish as the speaker is speaking. We say what happens **as it happens**. We talk about these actions and events when giving **commentary** or **telling stories**.

![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2007.png)

*Stories are in the past or in our imaginations, so we usually use the past form. However, storytellers sometimes use the present form to bring the story into the present for dramatic effect.*

### Practice

## past form

### What is it?
|present form|*past form*|ing form|en form|
|---|---|---|---|
|eat|*ate*|eating|eaten|
|work|*worked*|working|worked|
|have|*had*|having|had|
|play|*played*|playing|played|

### What does it mean?
Verbs in the ***past form*** show us we are NOT referring to the present-future.

![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2001.png)

### How do we use it?
We use verbs in the ***past form*** to refer to the past. Actions and events that happened in the past are **finished**.

![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2002.png)

|||
|---|---|
|We use the *past form* to talk about things that happened at a **point** of time in the past.|We are use the *past form* to talk about things that happened over a **period** of time in the past.|
|![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2003.png)|![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2004.png)|

We are talking about a specific time in the past, so we often need to say when it was.

|Subject|*Verb*|Object|Place|*Time*|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|**ate**|eggs||this morning.|We ate eggs this morning.|
|She|**worked**|||on Wednesday.|She worked on Wednesday.|
|They|**lived**||in Sweden|in 2007.|They lived in Sweden in 2007.|
|You|**liked**|swimming.||last week.|You liked swimming last week.|
|He|**had**|breakfast||at 7:30.|He had breakfast at 7:30.|
|I|**played**|soccer||on Sunday.|I played soccer on Sunday.|

Sometimes exactly when doesn't matter. We know it is in the recent past.
> I **got** a new bike! *(The listener knows that this must have happened recently.)*

We also use the *past form* to describe things that were true in the past.

![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2005.png)

We add *did*(the past form of do) to make questions and negative sentences.

|Questions|Negatives|
|---|---|
|***Did*** you **eat** eggs this morning?|We ***didn't*** **eat** eggs this morning.|
|***Did*** she **work** on Wednesday?|She ***didn't*** **work** on Wednesday.|
|***Did*** they **live** in Sweden in 2007?|They ***didn't*** **live** in Sweden in 2007.|
|***Did*** you **like** swimming last week?|You ***didn't*** **like** swimming last week.|
|***Did*** he **have** breakfast at 7:30?|He ***didn't*** **have** breakfast at 7:30.|
|***Did*** you **play** soccer on Sunday?|You ***didn't*** **play** soccer on Sunday.|

> Notice that only the ***first verb*** gets changed to the **past form**. The ***first verb*** provides us with essentail information, so the other verbs stay in the basic **present form**.

### Practice
Complete the sentences using the past form.

**Example**: I <u>did</u>  (do) yoga last Friday.

1. I ____ (go) to school yesterday.
2. I ____ (not eat) breakfast this morning.
3. ____ (you play) golf last week?
4. ____ (he go) to work this morning?
5. They ____ (not go) on vacation in July.
6. She ____ (not live) in South Africa last year.
7. We ____ (have) a good day on Sunday.

### Compare the *past form* and the *present form*.
We use the *past form* for descriptions in the past.

We use the *present form* for descriptions in the prensent-future.

> ![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2006.png)
> 
> Nara **was** the capital of Japan. *(true in the past)*
>
> I **wasn't** hungry after work. *So I didn't eat.*
>
> **Were** they delicious? *There are none left.*

> ![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2007.png)
> 
> Tokyo **is** the capital of Japan. *(true in the present)*
>
> I **'m not** hungry.
>
> **Are** the delicious?

We use the *past form* for events in the past(the past can't be changed) and the *present form* for fixed events in the future(these things can't be changed). We say or know when the happen.

> ![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2008.png)
> 
> The meeting **started** *at 10:30*.
>
> The game **wasn't** *on Sunday.*
>
> *When* **did** the bus leave?

> ![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2009.png)
> 
> The meeting **starts** *at 10:30.*
>
> The game **isn't** *on Sunday.*
>
> *When* **does** the bus leave?

We use the *past form* for actions that happened in the past.

We use the *present form* for actions that happen in the present, as speaker speaks. *(These things finish in the present; they finish before we finish speaking.)*

> ![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2010.png)
> 
> I **went** shopping.
> 
> He **didn't** lock the door.
> 
> **Did** you play golf?

> ![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2011.png)
> 
> She **doesn't** pass the ball.
>
> She **shoots**.
>
> **Does** it have the distance?

When we use the *present form* and don't know exactly when an action happens, we understand that the speaker is speaking **generally** and it happens **many times**. *(This is most common.)*

> ![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/past%20form%2012.png)
> 
> I **go** shopping.
>
> He **doesn't** lock the door.
>
> **Do** you play golf?

### Practice

    A: Where do you work?
    B: I ____ (work) in a restaurant, but I ____ (not work) yesterday.
    A: What ____ (you do) yesterday?
    B: I ____ (play) golf.
    A: Where ____ (you play)?
    B: At the golf club. How about you? What sport ____ (you like)?
    A: I ____ (not like sport). I ____ (play tennis) last week, but I ____ (not like) it.
