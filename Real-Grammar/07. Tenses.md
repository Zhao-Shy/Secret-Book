## introduction to verb forms

Different verb forms are used to give different information about time.

The following this sections explore these verb forms and their uses.

The first verb of the sentences gives us **basic information** about the time we are referring to.

The first verb is either in the *present form* or *past form*.

We will look at these **two** forms in more detail in this section.

|present form|past form|
|---|---|
|be/am/is/are|was/were|
|have/has|had|
|go/goes|went|
|get/gets|got|
|say/says|said|
|do/does|did|
|make/makes|made|
|know/knows|knew|
|think/thinks|thought|
|take/takes|took|
|see/sees|saw|
|want/wants|wanted|
|look/looks|looked|
|use/uses|used|
|find/finds|found|
|give/gives|gave|
|We add the *s* when the subject is a *he, she* or *it*. The meaning of the verb is the same, but the subject is different.|Some common verbs have *past form* that are different to the *present form*. With most verbs, we use the *present form* **+** *-ed*.|
|I **eat** breakfast. / He **eats** breakfast.|I **ate** breakfast this morning.|
|I **live** in England. / She **lives** in England.|She **lived** in England last year.|

We use the *-ing form* or *-en form* to add **extra information**.

|-ing form|-en form|
|---|---|
|being|been|
|having|had|
|going|gone|
|getting|gotten|
|saying|said|
|doing|done|
|making|made|
|knowing|known|
|thinking|thought|
|taking|taken|
|seeing|seen|
|wanting|wanted|
|looking|looked|
|using|used|
|finding|found|
|giving|given|
|All *-ing form* end in *-ing*.|Some verbs have a separate form often ending in *-en, -ne* or *n*. However, most verbs use the same form as the *past form*.|
|I'm eating breakfast. *(now)*|I've eaten breakfast.|
|She's living in England. *(now)*|She's lived in England.|

## present form
The verbs in the sentences we have looked at so far have been in the *present form*.

### What is it?
|*present form*|past form|ing form|en form|
|---|---|---|---|
|*eat*|ate|eating|eaten|
|*work*|worked|working|worked|
|*have*|had|having|had|
|*play*|played|playing|played|

### What does it mean?
We talk about things that are generally true. Things that are generally true are true in the **present-future**. They may be true in the past too.

### How do we use it?

|||
|---|---|
|We use the *present form* to talk about things that happen **many times**.|We use the *present form* to talk about things that are generally **permanent**.|
|![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2002.png)|![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2003.png)|

|Subject|*Verb*|Object|Place/Time|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|**eat**||at work.|We eat at work.|
|She|**works**||on Wednesdays.|She workd on Wednesdays.|
|They|**live**||in Sweden.|They live in Sweden.|
|You|**like**|swimming.||You like swimming.|
|He|**has**|breakfast|at 7:30|He has breakfast at 7:30.|
|I|**play**|soccer|on Sundays.|I play soccer on Sundays.|

We talk about things that are always true. These are **facts**.

![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2004.png)

We talk about things that are true now. These are **descriptions**. *(We describe things in the present.)*

![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2005.png)

Things may be generally true because they are fixed, and can't be changed or controlled. These are **scheduled events**. We often add a **future time** to make this clear.

![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2006.png)

We talk about quick actions or events that finish as the speaker is speaking. We say what happens **as it happens**. We talk about these actions and events when giving **commentary** or **telling stories**.

![](./static-resource/07.%20Tenses/present%20form%2007.png)

*Stories are in the past or in our imaginations, so we usually use the past form. However, storytellers sometimes use the present form to bring the story into the present for dramatic effect.*
