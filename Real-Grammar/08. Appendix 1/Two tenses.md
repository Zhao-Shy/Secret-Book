# Two tenses
core concepts

Many English grammar books suggest the English language has three tenses. This is false. English is a two tense language.

"And even at the level of the broad framework of grammatical principles, we have frequently found that pronouncements unchallenged for 200 years are in fact flagrantly false." - Rodney Huddlestion and Geoffrey K. Pullum (2005), A Student's Introduction to English Grammar, Cambridge University Press.

Huddleston and Pullum go on to explain that English has two primary tenses.

#### Why is English traditionally classified as having three tenses?

Latin has three tenses. People looked at Latin grammar (which has verbs inflected for past, present and future) and assigned the same categories to English. Current linguistic theory clearly states that English has two tenses, however, many grammar books for students are still written based on the traditional (and incorrect) classification. *Real Grammar* is consistent with current linguistic theory, explaining English grammar based on English. It is crucial that students are given the correct framework for the language they are studying.

"[W]e have no more business with a *future tense* in our language, than we have with the whole system of Latin moods and tenses" - Joseph Priestley (1772), *The Rudiments of English Grammar (3rd Editon)*.

## no future tense
*Real Grammar* describe English as having **two tenses**: the present tense (referring to the present-future), and the past tense (NOT referring to the present-future). Many grammar books say English has three tenses: past, present and future. It doesn't. Recognizing that English only has two tenses helps students understand English on a deeper level and avoid many common errors.

The first verb of every English sentence indicates tense and is in either the persent form (present-future) or past form (not present-future).

Some people claim that the so called 'future tense' is not constructed with verb inflection, but with the 'future tense marker' *will*. There are two main reasons why this is confusing for students:

### 1. *Will* is used for the present
*Will* is actually in the present form (its past form is *would*), so it is used to talk about the present-future. It is better not to use the term 'future tenses' because the so called 'future simple', 'future perfect' and 'future progressive', are often used to talk about the present.
> He's been working really hard so he **'ll be** hungry.
> - (future simple: description in the present)
>
> My daughter is very helpful. She **'ll** always **pick** up garbage and put it in the trash.
> - (future simple: general statement referring to what she does - generally in the present-future, as well as the past)
>
> They **will have arrived** by now.
> - (future perfect: result of action in the present)
>
> She **'ll be sleeping** now.
> - (future progressive: unfinished action in the present)

### 2. Using *will* is not the simplest way of talking about the future
