We use *are* to talk about two or more people or thins, or the person we are talking to (You **are**...).

## adding *s* to verbs
We add s to verbs when we are talking about *ONE* other person or thing.(*he, she,* or *it*).
|Subject|Verb|Object/Place||Subject|*Verb*|Object/Place|reulstant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|eat||-->|He|**eats**||He eats|
|You|work||-->|It|**works**||It works|
|We|live|in Europe|-->|She|**lives**|in Europe|She lives in Europe|
|They|like|swimming|-->|He|**likes**|swimming|He likes swimming|
|We|have|breakfast|-->|He|**has**|breakfast|He has breakfast|
|They|play|music|-->|It|**plays**|music|It plays music|

***Hava*** becomes ***has***.
- We have breakfast --> He has breakfast

We add es to verbs that end in ***-o***, ***-ch***, ***-x***, ***-sh*** and ***-ss*** to make the extra *s* sound in the word clear.
- I do karate.      --> He *does* karate.
- You go to school. --> She *goes* to school
- We watch TV.      --> He *watches* TV.
- They fix cars.    --> She *fixes* cars.
- I push buttons.   --> He *pushes* buttons.
- I miss you.       --> She *misses* you.

### Practice
Complete the sentences.

    1. I like fish.--> He________.
    2. We mix cement.--> She________.
    3. He drinks milk.--> We________.
    4. They play tennis.--> She________.
    5. You have a car.--> I________.
    6. I have black hair.--> He________.
    7. We go to work.--> She________.

We use *does* in questions and answers.
|*dose*|Subject|*Verb*|Object/Place|Resultant|Answer|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Does**|he|eat?||Does he eat?|Yes, he does|
|**Does**|it|work?||Does it work?|No, it doesn't.|
|**Does**|She|live|in Europe?|Does she live in Europe?|Yes, she does.|
|**Does**|he|like|swimming?|Does he like swimming?|No, he doesn't.|
|**Does**|She|have|breakfast?|Does she have breakfast?|No, she doesn't.|
|**Does**|it|play|music?|Does it play music?|Yes, it does.|

We can make these sentences negative by adding *doesn't* (dose not).
|Subject|*doesn't*|*Verb*|Object/Place|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|He|doesn't|eat.||He doesn't eat.|
|It|doesn't|work.||It doesn't work.|
|She|doesn't|live|in Europe.|She doesn't live in Europe.|
|He|doesn't|like|swimming.|He doesn't like swimming.|
|She|doesn't|have|breakfast.|She doesn't have breakfast.|
|It|doesn't|play|music.|It doesn't play music.|

These sentences have **TWO** verbs. Only the ***first*** verb gets *s*. Using *does* instead of *do* (*doesn't* instead of *don't*) provides essential information. The other verbs stay in the basic form.

### Practice
Make these sentences questions. Make these sentences negative.
|**Example**: I drink coffee. --> *(She)* **Does** she drink coffee.|**Example**: I drink coffee. --> He doesn't drink coffee.|
|---|---|
|I like seafood. --> *(He)*________.|I like seafood. --> She________.|
|I shower. --> *(He)*________.|I shower. --> We________.|
|I do karate. --> *(She)*________.|I do karate. --> He________.|

Complete the sentences with the correct form of the words in brackets.

Example: He doesn't like *(not like)* fish.
- 1. _______ she ________ *(eat)* beef?
- 2. He ________ *(eat)* beef.
- 3. We ________ *(not play)* golf.
- 4. _______ you ________ *(play)* golf?
- 5. _______ he ________ *(play)* golf?

## who and what
We use *who* to ask about a **person**. We use *what* to ask about a **thing**.

|**Who**||lives|in Washington.|
||*I*|*live*|*in Washington.*|
||I|do.||
|**What**||is|in the bag?|

|**Who**|**does**|she|help?|
|||*She*|*hepls*|the poor.|
|**What**|**do**|you|eat?|

*When we ask about **now** we say **'What time is it?'***

When we ask about another time we use *what time*, *what day*, *what month*, *what year* or *when*.

We say *'What time is the meeting?'* or *'When is the meeting?'*

## go
We use *go* to talk about movement from one place to another place. Things move to a destination. The destination can be a place, event thing or person.

![](./static-resource/03.%20Basic%20verbs/go%2001.png)

|Subject|*Verv(go)*|*Destination*|Time|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|go|**to work**|at 6PM.|I go to work at 6PM.|
|You|go|**to karate**|on Wednesdays.|You go to karate on Wednesdays.|
|We|go|**to Japan**|every winter.|We go to Japan every winter.|
|They|go|**to the sea**|in summer.|They go to the sea in summer.|
|She|goes|**home**|at 7:30.|She goes to home at 7:30.|
|He|goes|**to the doctor**|once year.|He goes to the doctor onec a year.|

We use ***'to'*** with destinations we can easily point out or circle.

![](./static-resource/03.%20Basic%20verbs/go%2002.png)

We don't use ***'to'*** with *home* or with other words like *overseas* and *abroad*, as they are not destinations we can clearly define. We can't point to *home*, *overseas* or *abroad* on a map.

![](./static-resource/03.%20Basic%20verbs/go%2003.png)

- I go **home** at 7:30.
  - This could mean: to my house, my city, my state, my country, etc. depending on the situation.
- I'm home!
  - This is often said when people arrive home. (the idea: it doesn't matter where it is; it could be a country, house, etc. - a place I feel is home)
- Where are you? - I'm **at home**.
  - This refers to someones house. We need to make it clear we are talking about a point in space, so we use ***at*** to compress home as a point.

---

## get
We use ***get*** to talk about changes. ***Get*** can be used in lots of situations.

![](./static-resource/03.%20Basic%20verbs/get%2001.png)

|Subject|*Verb(get)*|Object|Place/Time|
|---|---|---|---|
|I|**get**|breakfast|at the cafe.|
|You|**get**|milk|from a cow.|
|He|**gets**|coffee|every morning.|
|She|**gets**|groceries|at the supermarket.|

Keeping things simple is good. ***Get*** is a simple verb that can be uesd instead of other verbs, such as: *receive, buy,* or *obtain*.

![](./static-resource/03.%20Basic%20verbs/get%2002.png)

|Subject|*Verb(get)*|Description|Place/Time|
|---|---|---|---|
|It|**gets**|hot|in summer.|
|You|**get**|older|every year.|
|She|**gets**|hungry|at lunch time.|
|He|**gets**|sleepy|in the afternoon.|

|---|---|---|---|
|I|**get**|to work|at 8:30.|
|We|**get**|to school|at 8:50.|
|She|**gets**|home|at 7PM.|
|He|**gets**|to bed|at midnight.|

In this situation, ***get to(place)*** can be used instead of ***arrive at(place)***.
