# Putting it together
perfect aspect and progressive aspect

## have + been + -ing
We use *have + -en form* and *be + -ing form* together.

![](./static-resource/12.%20Putting%20it%20together/have%20+%20been%20+%20-ing%2001.png)

We use *have(present form)* + the *-en form* to talk about results in the present.

We use *be + -ing form* to talk about an activity in its unfinished state.

|||
|---|---|
|It may **not** be **finished**.|It may be **finished**.|
|This is useful when talking about **recent activities**.|**Doing this activity causes a result**.|
|*We are focusing on doing the activity, not finishing it.*| *The activity causes the result, not its completion.*|
|**A**: What have you been doing recently? **B**: I **'ve been reading** a book.|**A**: Why are you wet? **B**: I **'ve been swimming**.|

|*It is not finished, but I have a result in the present (I have read some.)*|*The activity (swimming) casued the result (wet). It is finished. It is obvious that I'm not swimming now.*|

|Subject|*have*|*be(en)*|*Verb(-ing)*|Object|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|She|**has**|**been**|**waiting**.||She's been waiting. *(result: She is next.)*|
|I|**hava**|**been**|**watching**|TV.|I've been watching TV. *(result: news)*|
|He|**has**|**been**|**drinking**.||He's been drinking.|

|*have*|Subject|*be(en)*|*Verb(-ing)*|Object|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Has**|she|**been**|**waiting**?||Has she been waiting?|
|**Hava**|you|**been**|**watching**|TV?|Have you been watching TV?|
|**Has**|he|**been**|**drinking**?||Has he been drinking?|

|Subject|*have not*|*be(en)*|*Verb(-ing)*|Object|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|She|**hasn't**|**been**|**waiting**.||She hasn't been waiting. *(result: She is next.)*|
|I|**havan't**|**been**|**watching**|TV.|I haven't been watching TV. *(result: news)*|
|He|**hasn't**|**been**|**drinking**.||He hasn't been drinking.|

When we ask someone how they are we often say:
> How are you? *(describing now)*

We often use other sentence patterns too. These are used a lot in friendly conversations. The meanings are slightly different, but because they are simply used to start a conversation it doesn't usually matter which one you use.
> How are you doing? *(now and into the future)*
>
> How have you been? *(past: up to now)*
>
> How have you been doing? *(past: up to now, now and into the future)*

We often use ask questions with *have + been doing* in friendly conversations.
> A: Hi. How have you been doing? 
> B: Good thanks.
> A: What have you been doing recently? 
> B: I've been playing a lot of sport.

We often use *up to* instead of *doing*. *Doing* and *up to* are both common in casual speech.
> What are you **up to**? ≈ What are you **doing**?
>
> What have you been **up to**? ≈ What have you been **doing**?

*There is a subtle difference: **doing** is about action, **up to** suggests we have completed part of something. We use **up to** to describe the next point. When talking about life in general we have completed part of our life up to a point.*

### Adding a time
We can add a **time period** to show how long these things have been happening. These things are not finished.

|Subject|*have*|*be(en)*|*Verb(-ing)*|Object|*Time period*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|She|**has**|**been**|waiting||**for ten minutes**.|
|I|**hava**|**been**|watching|TV|**all day**.|
|He|**has**|**been**|drinking||**since noon**.|
|It|**has**|**been**|raining||**since yesterday**.|

We are talking about what we have in the present. We can say how recent these things are by adding a time that includes the present.

|Subject|*have*|*be(en)*|*Verb(-ing)*|Object|*Time*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|She|**has**|**been**|swimming||**this morning**.|
|He|**hasn't**|**been**|drinking||**this week**.|
|It|**has**|**been**|raining||**today**.|


### Compare *have + been + -ing form* and *have + -en form*.
We use *have + been + -ing form* to talk about recent activities *(completed or not)*.

We use *have + -en form* to talk about results of recently completed acitons. *These are finished*.

>
> My eyes are tired. I **'ve been looking** at the computer all day.
> - If I say this at the end of the day we assume it is finished.

> ![](./static-resource/12.%20Putting%20it%20together/have%20+%20been%20+%20-ing%2004.png)
>
> I **have been writing** a book.
> - We assume this is not finished.
>
> What **have** you **been doing** (this week)?
> - We are asking about the time up to now, it doesn't matter if it's finished. This is friendly.

>
> I **have looked** at the computer. You need to do an update.
> - I've finished.
>
> I **have written** a book.
> - This is finished.
>
> What **have** you **done** (this week) ? 
> - We are asking about something that finished recently with a result in the present. A boss might ask this when wanting to know what is complete.
>
> Oh no! What **have** you **done** ?
> - We question something that someone did in the past that has a negative impact on the present.

We use both sentence patterns with *for* and *since*. *Have + -en form* simply refers to a period of time up to the present. *Have + been + -ing form* refers to something that is not finished, that has lasted a period of time up to the present. In most situations either can be used.

>
> I **have been playing** basketball *since I was a child*.
> - Up to now, this finishes in the future.
>
> I **have been living** in Japan *for a year*.
> - This will finish, I'll move somewhere else someday.

>
> I **have played** basketball *since I was a child*.
> - Up to now, We aren't thinking about it finishing.
>
> I **have lived** in Japan *for a year*.
> - We are not thinking about it finishing.
>
> I **have lived** *for 30 years**.
> - We are not thinking about it finishing.

We know if it has started or finished because of the **context**.

Recent activities have started. We can think about them in two ways. Both fit the same situation. Some people may tend to use one more than the other.
