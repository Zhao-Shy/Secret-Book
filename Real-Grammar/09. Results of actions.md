# Results of actions
perfect aspect

## -en form
### What is it?
Many common verbs have an *-en form*. These words end in *-en, ne* or *-n*.

|present form|past form|-ing form|*-en form*|
|---|---|---|---|
|eat|ate|eating|*eaten*|
|do|did|doing|*done*|
|know|knew|knowing|*known*|

Some verbs change vowels for their different forms and have a *u* (*n* upside-down) for the *-en form*.

|present form|past form|-ing form|*-en form (u)*|
|---|---|---|---|
|drink|drank|drinking|*drunk*|
|swim|swam|swimming|*swum*|

However, **most verbs don't have a separate *-en from***. We use the same form as the *past form*.

|present form|past form|-ing form|*-en meaning*|
|---|---|---|---|
|wash|washed|washing|*washed*|
|have|had|having|*had*|
|love|loved|loving|*loved*|

We know it has the meaning of the *-en form* because of where it is used in the sentence, often after *have*. *(The **past form** is used directly after the subject.)*

> I **washed** the car yesterday. *(past form)*
>
> I've **washed** the car. *(-en form meaning)*

### What does it mean?

![](./static-resource/09.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2001.png)

We use the *-en form* to shift focus away from an action.

Details of the action, such as when it happened, are not important.

We use *have* and the *-en form* to focus on the **result** of an aciton.

### How do we use it?

We often use it with *have*. We have results in the present.

|||
|---|---|
|We talk about **recently completed actions**.|We talk about **experiences**.|
|I ***have eaten*** breakfast.|I ***have lived*** in England.|
|![](./static-resource/09.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2002.png)|![](./static-resource/09.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2003.png)
|*Breakfast is complete.*|*I lived in England sometime in the past.*|
|*When it happened isn't important.*|*When it happened isn't important.*|
|*The result is important: I don't need to eat now.*|*The result is important: I have the experience now.*|

We are talking about the present. If we say when, we add a time that includes the present.

|||
|---|---|
|I ***have eaten*** breakfast *today*.|I ***have lived*** in England *this year*.|

|*Recently completed actions*|*Experiences*|
|---|---|
|I've eaten.|He's played soccer.|
|She's had breakfast.|We've lived in London.|
|They've cooked dinner.|They've worked in a shop.|

![](./static-resource/09.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2004.png)

We use *have* with the *-en form*.

> The present form of *have* shows us this is in the **present-future**.
>
> ![](./static-resource/09.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2005.png)
> 
> We are talking about what we have **now**, in the **present**.

|Subject|*have*|*Verb*|Object|Place|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|**have**|**eaten**|eggs.||We've eaten eggs.|
|She|**has**|**worked**||in a bank.|She's worked in a bank.|
|I|**have**|**lived**||in Sweden.|I've lived in Sweden.|
|He|**has**|**had**|breakfast.||He's had breakfast.|
|You|**have**|**played**|soccer.||You've played soccer.|

> The *-en form* focuses on the **results** of actions.
>
> ![](./static-resource/09.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2006.png)
>
> Exactly when it happened is not important.

We put *have* first to make it a question.

|*have*|Subject|*Verb*|Object|Place|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Have**|you|**eaten**|eggs?||Have you eaten eggs?|
|**Has**|she|**worked**||in a bank?|Has she worked in a bank?|
|**Have**|you|**lived**||in Sweden?|Have you lived in Sweden?|
|**Has**|he|**had**|breakfast?||Has he had breakfast?|
|**Have**|you|**played**|soccer?||Have you played soccer?|

We add *not* after *have* to make it negative.

|Subject|*have*|*Verb*|Object|Place|Resultant|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We|**haven't**|**eaten**|eggs.||We haven't eaten eggs.|
|She|**hasn't**|**worked**||in a bank.|She hasn't worked in a bank.|
|I|**haven't**|**lived**||in Sweden.|I haven't lived in Sweden.|
|He|**hasn't**|**had**|breakfast.||He hasn't had breakfast.|
|You|**haven't**|**played**|soccer.||You haven't played soccer.|

*Been* and *gone* are used when we talk about people going places.

|||
|---|---|
|When we use *been* the person **was** somewhere or **was** doing something. They are not there or doing it now.|When we use *gone* the person **went** somewhere so we **don't know** exactly **where** they are now.|
|![](./static-resource/09.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2007.png)|![](./static-resource/09.%20Results%20of%20actions/-en%20form%2008.png)|
|He's ***been*** fishing.|He's ***gone*** fishing.|
|*He **was fishing** sometime in the past.*|*He **went fishing** sometime in the past.*|
|***He isn't fishing now.***|***He isn't here now.***|
|She's ***been*** to Seoul.|She's ***gone*** to Seoul.|
|*She went **to Seoul** sometime in the past.*|*She **went to Seoul** sometime in the past.*|
|*She **was** in Seoul. **She isn't in Seoul now.***|***She isn't here now.***|

### Practice
Complete the sentences using *have* and the *-en form*.

**Example**: I <u>haven't eaten</u> (not eat) breakfast yet.

1. ____ (you play) golf?
2. I ____ (send) you a letter.
3. ____ (you be) to Europe?
4. ____ (you hear) the news?
5. She ____ (not live) in South Africa.
6. I watched The Shawshank Redemption last night. ____ (you see) it?

## adding a length of time

When we talk about experiences, we can add a time period to show how much experience we have. This is the amount of experience we currently have in the present. We often assume we are still gaining experience in these things.

![](./static-resource/09.%20Results%20of%20actions/adding%20a%20length%20of%20time%2001.png)

|Subject|*have*|*Verb*|Object|Place/Time|*Time period*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|She|**has**|**worked**||in a bank|**for seven years**.|
|It|**has**|rained|||**for the last few days.**|
|I|**have**|**lived**||in Sweden|**since 2010**.|
|He|**has**|**played**|soccer||**since he was five**.|
|It|**has**|**been**||a while|***since I've seen you***.|

> ![](./static-resource/09.%20Results%20of%20actions/adding%20a%20length%20of%20time%2002.png)
>
> *How long* **has** she **worked** in a bank? She's worked in a bank for seven years.
> - She started working in the bank seven years ago. She still works there now.
>
> It **'s rained** for the last few days.
> - It started raining a few days ago. It is still raining now.
>
> *How long* **have** you **lived** in Sweden? I've lived in Sweden sicne 2010.
> - I moved to Sweden in 2010. I still live there now.
>
> He's a good soccer player. He **'s played** *soccer* since he was five.
> - He started playing soccer when he was five. He still plays soccer now.
>
> It **'s been** a while since I've seen you.
> - I haven't seen you for some time.

This pattern is also used for *recently completed actions*. We often add a time period when we think the action has happened for long enough and we want it to end now.

|Subject|*have*|*Verb*|Object|Place/Time|*Time period*|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|**have**|**waited**|||**for tow hours**.|
|I|**have**|**cooked**||every night|**for three months**.|
|He|**hasn't**|**eaten**|anything||**since Monday**.|

> I **'ve waited** *for two hours**.
> - It's too long.
>
> I **'ve cooked** every night *for three months*.
> - Can you do the cooking for a change?
>
> He **hasn't eaten** anything *since Monday*.
> - He really should eat something.

### Practice
Complete the conversation.

    A: Nice house! How long ____ you ____ (live) here?
    B: I ____ (live) here ____ about three years.
    A: You have a piano! Do you play it?
    B: Yes, I ____ (play) it ____ I was a child. I love it.

## ever and never

When we want to make it clear we are talking about experiences, we use *ever* with questions and *never* with negatives. *(never means not ever)*

When we are obviously talking about experiences we don't need *ever* and *never*, but we can use them to be clear. Either way is ok.

|Experiences|Experiences|
|---|---|
|Has he played soccer?|Has he **ever** played soccer?|
|He hasn't played soccer.|He's **never** played soccer.|
|Have you lived in London?|Have you **ever** lived in London?|
|We haven't lived in London.|We've **never** lived in London.|
|Have they worked in a shop?|Have they **ever** worked in a shop?|
|They haven't worked in a shop.|They've **never** worked in a shop.|

We can add *ever* and *never* to make it clear we are talking about an experience, and not a recently completed action.

|Recently complete actions|*Experiences*|
|---|---|
|Have you cooked dinner?|Have you **ever** cooked dinner?|
|I haven't cooked dinner.|I've **never** cooked dinner. My wife always cooks.|
|Have you cooked dinner? *(today) Or do I need to buy something for dinner?*|Have you **ever** cooked dinner? *at any time in your life*|
|I haven't cooked dinner. *(not today) I often cook.*|I've **never** cooked dinner. *not even once*|

### Practice 
Complete the conversation using *have* and the *-en form*. Use *ever* and *never* if you can.

**Example**: A: I'm hungry. I haven't eaten (not eat) since breakfast.

    B: I ____ (not eat) either.
    A: Do you want to get something to eat?
    B: Sure, ____ you ____ (have) Mexican food?
    A: Yes. I ____ (have) tacos.
    B: Have you ____ (have) a burrito?
    A: No. I ____ (have) one.
    B: They're really good. There's a good burrito place near here.
    A: Ok, let's go there.
