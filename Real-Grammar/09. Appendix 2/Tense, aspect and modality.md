The diagrams on the following pages show how tense and aspect combine to create a wide range of sentence patterns. We also look at how the core concept of modality relates to how we use modal verbs (can/could, will/would, shall/should, may/might and must). The third diagram looks at quasi-modality and how quasi-modal verbs relate to modal verbs.

These pages reflect traditional analyses of grammar, broken down into core concepts that are easier for students to understand.
